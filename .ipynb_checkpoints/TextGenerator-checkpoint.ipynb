The reader gratifies his\\r\\ncuriosity in pursuing the adventures of a person in whose favour he is\\r\\nprepossessed; he espouses his cause, he sympathises with him in his\\r\\ndistress, his indignation is heated against the authors of his\\r\\ncalamity: the humane passions are inflamed; the contrast between\\r\\ndejected virtue and insulting vice appears with greater aggravation,\\r\\nand every impression having a double force on the imagination, the\\r\\nmemory retains the circumstance, and the heart improves by the example.\\r\\nThe attention is not tired with a bare catalogue of characters, but\\r\\nagreeably diverted with all the variety of invention; and the\\r\\nvicissitudes of life appear in their peculiar circumstances, opening an\\r\\nample field for wit and humour.\\r\\n\\r\\nRomance, no doubt, owes its origin to ignorance, vanity, and\\r\\nsuperstition. In the dark ages of the World, when a man had rendered\\r\\nhimself famous for wisdom or valour, his family and adherents availed\\r\\nthemselves of his superior qualities, magnified his virtues, and\\r\\nrepresented his character and person as sacred and supernatural. The\\r\\nvulgar easily swallowed the bait, implored his protection, and yielded\\r\\nthe tribute of homage and praise, even to adoration; his exploits were\\r\\nhanded down to posterity with a thousand exaggerations; they were\\r\\nrepeated as incitements to virtue; divine honours were paid, and altars\\r\\nerected to his memory, for the encouragement of those who attempted to\\r\\nimitate his example; and hence arose the heathen mythology, which is no\\r\\nother than a collection of extravagant romances. As learning advanced,\\r\\nand genius received cultivation, these stories were embellished with\\r\\nthe graces of poetry, that they might the better recommend themselves\\r\\nto the attention; they were sung in public, at festivals, for the\\r\\ninstruction and delight of the audience; and rehearsed before battle,\\r\\nas incentives to deeds of glory. Thus tragedy and the epic muse were\\r\\nborn, and, in the progress of taste, arrived at perfection. It is no\\r\\nwonder that the ancients could not relish a fable in prose, after they\\r\\nhad seen so many remarkable events celebrated in verse by their best\\r\\npoets; we therefore find no romance among them during the era of their\\r\\nexcellence, unless the _CyropÃ¦dia_ of Xenophon may be so called; and it\\r\\nwas not till arts and sciences began to revive after the irruption of\\r\\nthe barbarians into Europe, that anything of this kind appeared. But\\r\\nwhen the minds of men were debauched by the imposition of priestcraft\\r\\nto the most absurd pitch of credulity, the authors of romance arose,\\r\\nand losing sight of probability, filled their performances with the\\r\\nmost monstrous hyperboles. If they could not equal the ancient poets in\\r\\npoint of genius they were resolved to excel them in fiction, and apply\\r\\nto the wonder, rather than the judgment, of their readers. Accordingly,\\r\\nthey brought necromancy to their aid, and instead of supporting the\\r\\ncharacter of their heroes by dignity of sentiment and practice,\\r\\ndistinguished them by their bodily strength, activity, and extravagance\\r\\nof behaviour. Although nothing could be more ludicrous and unnatural\\r\\nthan the figures they drew, they did not want patrons and admirers; and\\r\\nthe world actually began to be infected with the spirit of\\r\\nknight-errantry, when Cervantes, by an inimitable piece of ridicule,\\r\\nreformed the taste of mankind, representing chivalry in the right point\\r\\nof view, and converting romance to purposes far more useful and\\r\\nentertaining, by making it assume the sock, and point out the follies\\r\\nof ordinary life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same method has been practised by other Spanish and French authors,\\r\\nand by none more successfully than by Monsieur Le Sage, who, in his\\r\\n_Adventures of Gil Blas_, has described the knavery and foibles of\\r\\nlife, with infinite humour and sagacity. The following sheets I have\\r\\nmodelled on his plan, taking me liberty, however, to differ from him in\\r\\nthe execution, where I thought his particular situations were uncommon,\\r\\nextravagant, or peculiar to the country in which the scene is laid. The\\r\\ndisgraces of Gil Blas are, for the most part, such as rather excite\\r\\nmirth than compassion; he himself laughs at them; and his transitions\\r\\nfrom distress to happiness, or at least ease, are so sudden, that\\r\\nneither the reader has time to pity him, nor himself to be acquainted\\r\\nwith affliction. This conduct, in my opinion, not only deviates from\\r\\nprobability, but prevents that generous indignation, which ought to\\r\\nanimate the reader against the sordid and vicious disposition of the\\r\\nworld. I have attempted to represent modest merit struggling with every\\r\\ndifficulty to which a friendless orphan is exposed, from his own want\\r\\nof experience, as well as from the selfishness, envy, malice, and base\\r\\nindifference of mankind. To secure a favourable prepossession, I have\\r\\nallowed him the advantages of birth and education, which in the series\\r\\nof his misfortunes will, I hope, engage the ingenuous more warmly in\\r\\nhis behalf; and though I foresee, that some people will be offended at\\r\\nthe mean scenes in which he is involved, I persuade myself that the\\r\\njudicious will not only perceive the necessity of describing those\\r\\nsituations to which he must of course be confined, in his low estate,\\r\\nbut also find entertainment in viewing those parts of life, where the\\r\\nhumours and passions are undisguised by affectation, ceremony, or\\r\\neducation; and the whimsical peculiarities of disposition appear as\\r\\nnature has implanted them. But I believe I need not trouble myself in\\r\\nvindicating a practice authorized by the best writers in this way, some\\r\\nof whom I have already named.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery intelligent reader will, at first sight, perceive I have not\\r\\ndeviated from nature in the facts, which are all true in the main,\\r\\nalthough the circumstances are altered and disguised, to avoid personal\\r\\nsatire.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt now remains to give my reasons for making the chief personage of\\r\\nthis work a North Briton, which are chiefly these: I could, at a small\\r\\nexpense, bestow on him such education as I thought the dignity of his\\r\\nbirth and character required, which could not possibly be obtained in\\r\\nEngland, by such slender means as the nature of my plan would afford.\\r\\nIn the next place, I could represent simplicity of manners in a remote\\r\\npart of the kingdom, with more propriety than in any place near the\\r\\ncapital; and lastly, the disposition of the Scots, addicted to\\r\\ntravelling, justifies my conduct in deriving an adventurer from that\\r\\ncountry. That the delicate reader may not be offended at the unmeaning\\r\\noaths which proceed from the mouths of some persons in these memoirs, I\\r\\nbeg leave to promise, that I imagined nothing could more effectually\\r\\nexpose the absurdity of such miserable expletives, than a natural and\\r\\nverbal representation of the discourse in which they occur.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAPOLOGUE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA young painter, indulging a vein of pleasantry, sketched a kind of\\r\\nconversation piece, representing a bear, an owl, a monkey, and an ass;\\r\\nand to render it more striking, humorous, and moral, distinguished\\r\\nevery figure by some emblem of human life. Bruin was exhibited in the\\r\\ngarb and attitude of an old, toothless, drunken soldier; the owl\\r\\nperched upon the handle of a coffee-pot, with spectacle on nose, seemed\\r\\nto contemplate a newspaper; and the ass, ornamented with a huge tie-wig\\r\\n(which, however, could not conceal his long ears), sat for his picture\\r\\nto the monkey, who appeared with the implements of painting. This\\r\\nwhimsical group afforded some mirth, and met with general approbation,\\r\\nuntil some mischievous wag hinted that the wholeâ\\x80\\x94was a lampoon upon the\\r\\nfriends of the performer; an insinuation which was no sooner circulated\\r\\nthan those very people who applauded it before began to be alarmed, and\\r\\neven to fancy themselves signified by the several figures of the piece.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong others, a worthy personage in years, who had served in the army\\r\\nwith reputation, being incensed at the supposed outrage, repaired to\\r\\nthe lodging of the painter, and finding him at home, â\\x80\\x9cHark ye, Mr.\\r\\nMonkey,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI have a good mind to convince you, that though the\\r\\nbear has lost his teeth, he retains his paws, and that he is not so\\r\\ndrunk but he can perceive your impertinence.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSblood! sir, that\\r\\ntoothless jaw is a dâ\\x80\\x94ned scandalous libelâ\\x80\\x94but donâ\\x80\\x99t you imagine me so\\r\\nchopfallen as not to be able to chew the cud of resentment.â\\x80\\x9d Here he\\r\\nwas interrupted by the arrival of a learned physician, who, advancing\\r\\nto the culprit with fury in his aspect, exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cSuppose the\\r\\naugmentation of the assâ\\x80\\x99s ears should prove the diminution of the\\r\\nbaboonâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94nay, seek not to prevaricate, for, by the beard of\\r\\nAesculapius! there is not one hair in this periwig that will not stand\\r\\nup in judgment to convict thee of personal abuse. Do but observe,\\r\\ncaptain, how this pitiful little fellow has copied the very curlsâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\ncolour, indeed, is different, but then the form and foretop are quite\\r\\nsimilar.â\\x80\\x9d While he thus remonstrated in a strain of vociferation, a\\r\\nvenerable senator entered, and waddling up to the delinquent,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJackanapes!â\\x80\\x9d cried he, â\\x80\\x9cI will now let thee see I can read something\\r\\nelse than a newspaper, and that without the help of spectacles: here is\\r\\nyour own note of hand, sirrah, for money, which if I had not advanced,\\r\\nyou yourself would have resembled an owl, in not daring to show your\\r\\nface by day, you ungrateful slanderous knave!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain the astonished painter declared that he had no intention to\\r\\ngive offence, or to characterise particular persons: they affirmed the\\r\\nresemblance was too palpable to be overlooked; they taxed him with\\r\\ninsolence, malice, and ingratitude; and their clamours being overheard\\r\\nby the public, the captain was a bear, the doctor an ass, and the\\r\\nsenator an owl, to his dying day.\\r\\n\\r\\nChristian reader, I beseech thee, in the bowels of the Lord, remember\\r\\nthis example â\\x80\\x9cwhile thou art employed in the perusal of the following\\r\\nsheets; and seek not to appropriate to thyself that which equally\\r\\nbelongs to five hundred different people. If thou shouldst meet with a\\r\\ncharacter that reflects thee in some ungracious particular, keep thy\\r\\nown counsel; consider that one feature makes not a face, and that\\r\\nthough thou art, perhaps, distinguished by a bottle nose, twenty of thy\\r\\nneighbours may be in the same predicament.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURES OF RODERICK RANDOM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOf my Birth and Parentage\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI was born in the northern part of this united kingdom, in the house of\\r\\nmy grandfather, a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who\\r\\nhad on many occasions signalised himself in behalf of his country; and\\r\\nwas remarkable for his abilities in the law, which he exercised with\\r\\ngreat success in the station of a judge, particularly against beggars,\\r\\nfor whom he had a singular aversion.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father (his youngest son) falling in love with a poor relation, who\\r\\nlived with the old gentleman in quality of a housekeeper, espoused her\\r\\nprivately; and I was the first fruit of that marriage. During her\\r\\npregnancy, a dream discomposed my mother so much that her husband,\\r\\ntired with her importunity, at last consulted a highland seer, whose\\r\\nfavourable interpretation he would have secured beforehand by a bribe,\\r\\nbut found him incorruptible. She dreamed she was delivered of a\\r\\ntennis-ball, which the devil (who, to her great surprise, acted the\\r\\npart of a midwife) struck so forcibly with a racket that it disappeared\\r\\nin an instant; and she was for some time inconsolable for the lost of\\r\\nher offspring; when, all on a sudden, she beheld it return with equal\\r\\nviolence, and enter the earth, beneath her feet, whence immediately\\r\\nsprang up a goodly tree covered with blossoms, the scent of which\\r\\noperated so strongly on her nerves that she awoke. The attentive sage,\\r\\nafter some deliberation, assured my parents, that their firstborn would\\r\\nbe a great traveller; that he would undergo many dangers and\\r\\ndifficulties, and at last return to his native land, where he would\\r\\nflourish in happiness and reputation. How truly this was foretold will\\r\\nappear in the sequel. It was not long before some officious person\\r\\ninformed my grandfather of certain familiarities that passed between\\r\\nhis son and housekeeper which alarmed him so much that, a few days\\r\\nafter, he told my father it was high time for him to think of settling;\\r\\nand that he had provided a match for him, to which he could in justice\\r\\nhave no objections. My father, finding it would be impossible to\\r\\nconceal his situation much longer, frankly owned what he had done; and\\r\\nexcused himself for not having asked the consent of his father, by\\r\\nsaying, he knew it would have been to no purpose; and that, had his\\r\\ninclination been known, my grandfather might have taken such measures\\r\\nas would have effectually put the gratification of it out of his power:\\r\\nhe added, that no exceptions could be taken to his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s virtue,\\r\\nbirth, beauty, and good sense, and as for fortune, it was beneath his\\r\\ncare. The old gentleman, who kept all his passions, except one, in\\r\\nexcellent order, heard him to an end with great temper, and then calmly\\r\\nasked, how he proposed to maintain himself and spouse? He replied, he\\r\\ncould be in no danger of wanting while his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s tenderness\\r\\nremained, which he and his wife should always cultivate with the utmost\\r\\nveneration; and he was persuaded his allowance would be suitable to the\\r\\ndignity and circumstances of his family, and to the provision already\\r\\nmade for his brothers and sisters, who were happily settled under his\\r\\nprotection. â\\x80\\x9cYour brothers and sisters,â\\x80\\x9d said my grandfather, â\\x80\\x9cdid not\\r\\nthink it beneath them to consult me in an affair of such importance as\\r\\nmatrimony; neither, I suppose, would you have omitted that piece of\\r\\nduty, had you not some secret fund in reserve; to the comforts of which\\r\\nI leave you, with a desire that you will this night seek out another\\r\\nhabitation for yourself and wife, whither, in a short time, I will send\\r\\nyou an account of the expense I have been at in your education, with a\\r\\nview of being reimbursed. Sir, you have made the grand tourâ\\x80\\x94you are a\\r\\npolite gentlemanâ\\x80\\x94a very pretty gentlemanâ\\x80\\x94I wish you a great deal of\\r\\njoy, and am your very humble servant.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, he left my father in a situation easily imagined. However,\\r\\nhe did not long hesitate; for, being perfectly well acquainted with his\\r\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s disposition, he did not doubt that he was glad of this\\r\\npretence to get rid of him; and his resolves being as invariable as the\\r\\nlaws of the Medes and Persians, he knew it would be to no purpose to\\r\\nattempt him by prayers and entreaties; so without any farther\\r\\napplication, he betook himself, with his disconsolate bedfellow to a\\r\\nfarm-house, where an old servant of his mother dwelt: there they\\r\\nremained some time in a situation but ill adapted to the elegance of\\r\\ntheir desires and tenderness of their love; which nevertheless my\\r\\nfather chose to endure, rather than supplicate an unnatural and\\r\\ninflexible parent but my mother, foreseeing the inconveniences to which\\r\\nshe must have been exposed, had she been delivered in this place (and\\r\\nher pregnancy was very far advanced), without communicating her design\\r\\nto her husband, went in disguise to the house of my grandfather, hoping\\r\\nthat her tears and condition would move him to compassion, and\\r\\nreconcile him to an event which was now irrecoverably past.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe found means to deceive the servants, and get introduced as an\\r\\nunfortunate lady, who wanted to complain of some matrimonial\\r\\ngrievances, it being my grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s particular province to decide in\\r\\nall cases of scandal. She was accordingly admitted into his presence,\\r\\nwhere, discovering herself, she fell at his feet, and in the most\\r\\naffecting manner implored his forgiveness; at the same time\\r\\nrepresenting the danger that threatened not only her life, but that of\\r\\nhis own grandchild, which was about to see the light. He told her he\\r\\nwas sorry that the indiscretion of her and his son had compelled him to\\r\\nmake a vow, which put it out of his power to give them any assistance;\\r\\nthat he had already imparted his thoughts on that subject to her\\r\\nhusband, and was surprised that they should disturb his peace with any\\r\\nfarther importunity. This said, he retired.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe violence of my motherâ\\x80\\x99s affliction had such an effect on her\\r\\nconstitution that she was immediately seized with the pains of\\r\\nchildbed; and had not an old maidservant, to whom she was very dear,\\r\\nafforded her pity and assistance, at the hazard of incurring my\\r\\ngrandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s displeasure, she and the innocent fruit of her womb must\\r\\nhave fallen miserable victims to his rigour and inhumanity. By the\\r\\nfriendship of this poor woman she was carried up to a garret, and\\r\\nimmediately delivered of a man child, the story of whose unfortunate\\r\\nbirth he himself now relates. My father, being informed of what had\\r\\nhappened, flew to the embraces of his darling spouse, and while he\\r\\nloaded his offspring with paternal embraces, could not forbear shedding\\r\\na flood of tears on beholding the dear partner of his heart (for whose\\r\\nease he would have sacrificed the treasures of the east) stretched upon\\r\\na flock bed, in a miserable apartment, unable to protect her from the\\r\\ninclemencies of the weather. It is not to be supposed that the old\\r\\ngentleman was ignorant of what passed, though he affected to know\\r\\nnothing of the matter, and pretended to be very much surprised, when\\r\\none of his grandchildren, by his eldest son deceased, who lived with\\r\\nhim as his heir apparent, acquainted him with the affair; he determined\\r\\ntherefore to observe no medium, but immediately (on the third day after\\r\\nher delivery) sent her a peremptory order to be gone, and turned off\\r\\nthe servant who had preserved her life. This behaviour so exasperated\\r\\nmy father that he had recourse to the most dreadful imprecations; and\\r\\non his bare knees implored that Heaven would renounce him if ever he\\r\\nshould forget or forgive the barbarity of his sire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe injuries which this unhappy mother received from her removal in\\r\\nsuch circumstances, and the want of necessaries where she lodged,\\r\\ntogether with her grief and anxiety of mind, soon threw her into a\\r\\nlanguishing disorder, which put an end to her life. My father, who\\r\\nloved her tenderly, was so affected with her death that he remained six\\r\\nweeks deprived of his senses; during which time, the people where he\\r\\nlodged carried the infant to the old man who relented so far, on\\r\\nhearing the melancholy story of his daughter-in-lawâ\\x80\\x99s death, and the\\r\\ndeplorable condition of his son, as to send the child to nurse, and he\\r\\nordered my father to be carried home to his house, where he soon\\r\\nrecovered the use of his reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether this hardhearted judge felt any remorse for his cruel treatment\\r\\nof his son and daughter, or (which is more probable) was afraid his\\r\\ncharacter would suffer in the neighbourhood, he professed great sorrow\\r\\nfor his conduct to my father, whose delirium was succeeded by a\\r\\nprofound melancholy and reserve. At length he disappeared, and,\\r\\nnotwithstanding all imaginable inquiry, could not be heard of; a\\r\\ncircumstance which confirmed most people in the opinion of his having\\r\\nmade away with himself in a fit of despair. How I understood the\\r\\nparticulars of my birth will appear in the course of these memoirs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI grow upâ\\x80\\x94am hated by my Relationsâ\\x80\\x94sent to Schoolâ\\x80\\x94neglected by my\\r\\nGrandfatherâ\\x80\\x94maltreated by my Masterâ\\x80\\x94seasoned to Adversityâ\\x80\\x94I form Cabals\\r\\nagainst the Pedantâ\\x80\\x94am debarred Access to my Grandfatherâ\\x80\\x94hunted by his\\r\\nHeirâ\\x80\\x94I demolish the Teeth of his Tutor\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were not wanting some who suspected my uncles of being concerned\\r\\nin my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s fate, on the supposition that they would all share in\\r\\nthe patrimony destined for him; and this conjecture was strengthened by\\r\\nreflecting that in all his calamities they never discovered the least\\r\\ninclination to serve him; but, on the contrary, by all the artifices in\\r\\ntheir power, fed his resentment and supported his resolution of leaving\\r\\nhim to misery and want. But people of judgment treated this insinuation\\r\\nas an idle chimera; because, had my relations been so wicked as to\\r\\nconsult their interest by committing such an atrocious crime, the fate\\r\\nof my father would have extended to me too whose life was another\\r\\nobstacle to their expectation. Meanwhile, I grew apace, and as I\\r\\nstrongly resembled my father, who was the darling of the tenants, I\\r\\nwanted nothing which their indigent circumstances could afford: but\\r\\ntheir favour was a weak resource against the jealous enmity of my\\r\\ncousins; who the more my infancy promised, conceived the more\\r\\nimplacable hatred against me: and before I was six years of age, had so\\r\\neffectually blockaded my grandfather that I never saw him but by\\r\\nstealth, when I sometimes made up to his chair as he sat to view his\\r\\nlabourers in the field: on which occasion he would stroke my head, bid\\r\\nme be a good boy, and promise to take care of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was soon after sent to school at a village hard by, of which he had\\r\\nbeen dictator time out of mind; but as he never paid for my board, nor\\r\\nsupplied me with clothes, books, and other necessaries I required, my\\r\\ncondition was very ragged and contemptible, and the schoolmaster, who,\\r\\nthrough fear of my grandfather, taught me gratis, gave himself no\\r\\nconcern about the progress I made under his instruction. In spite of\\r\\nall these difficulties and disgraces, I became a good proficient in the\\r\\nLatin tongue; and, as soon as I could write tolerably, pestered my\\r\\ngrandfather with letters to such a degree that he sent for my master,\\r\\nand chid him severely for bestowing such pains on my education, telling\\r\\nhim that, if ever I should be brought to the gallows for forgery, which\\r\\nhe had taught me to commit, my blood would lie on his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pedant, who dreaded nothing more than the displeasure of his\\r\\npatron, assured his honour that the boyâ\\x80\\x99s ability was more owing to his\\r\\nown genius and application than to any instruction or encouragement he\\r\\nreceived; that, although he could not divest him of the knowledge he\\r\\nhad already imbibed, unless he would empower him to disable his\\r\\nfingers, he should endeavour, with Godâ\\x80\\x99s help, to prevent his future\\r\\nimprovement. And, indeed, he punctually performed what he had\\r\\nundertaken; for, on pretence that I had written impertinent letters to\\r\\nmy grandfather, he caused a board to be made with five holes in it,\\r\\nthrough which he thrust the fingers and thumb of my right hand, and\\r\\nfastened it by whipcord to my wrist, in such a manner as effectually\\r\\ndebarred me the use of my pen. But this restraint I was freed from in a\\r\\nfew days, by an accident which happened in a quarrel between me and\\r\\nanother boy; who, taking upon him to insult my poverty, I was so\\r\\nincensed at his ungenerous reproach that with one stroke with my\\r\\nmachine I cut him to the skull, to the great terror of myself and\\r\\nschoolfellows, who left him bleeding on the ground, and ran to inform\\r\\nthe master of what had happened. I was so severely punished for this\\r\\ntrespass that, were I to live to the age of Methusalem, the impression\\r\\nit made on me would not be effaced; the more than the antipathy and\\r\\nhorror I conceived for the merciless tyrant who inflicted it. The\\r\\ncontempt which my appearance naturally produced in all who saw me, the\\r\\ncontinual wants to which I was exposed, and my own haughty disposition,\\r\\nimpatient of affronts, involved me in a thousand troublesome\\r\\nadventures, by which I was at length inured in adversity, and\\r\\nemboldened to undertakings far above my years. I was often inhumanly\\r\\nscourged for crimes I did not commit, because, having the character of\\r\\na vagabond in the village, every piece of mischief, whose author lay\\r\\nunknown, was charged upon me. I have been found guilty of robbing\\r\\norchards I never entered, of killing cats I never hunted, of stealing\\r\\ngingerbread I never touched, and of abusing old women I never saw. Nay,\\r\\na stammering carpenter had eloquence enough to persuade my master that\\r\\nI fired a pistol loaded with small shot into his window; though my\\r\\nlandlady and the whole family bore witness that I was abed fast asleep\\r\\nat the time when this outrage was committed. I was once flogged for\\r\\nhaving narrowly escaped drowning, by the sinking of a ferry boat in\\r\\nwhich I was passenger. Another time, for having recovered of a bruise\\r\\noccasioned by a horse and cart running over me. A third time, for being\\r\\nbitten by a bakerâ\\x80\\x99s dog. In short, whether I was guilty or unfortunate,\\r\\nthe correction and sympathy of this arbitrary pedagogue were the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar from being subdued by this informal usage, my indignation triumphed\\r\\nover that slavish awe which had hitherto enforced my obedience; and the\\r\\nmore my years and knowledge increased, the more I perceived the\\r\\ninjustice and barbarity of his behaviour. By the help of an uncommon\\r\\ngenius, and the advice and direction of our usher, who had served my\\r\\nfather in his travels, I made a surprising progress in the classics,\\r\\nwriting, and arithmetic; so that, before I was twelve years old, I was\\r\\nallowed by everybody to be the best scholar in the school. This\\r\\nqualification, together with the boldness of temper and strength of\\r\\nmake which had subjected almost all my contemporaries, gave me such\\r\\ninfluence over them that I began to form cabals against my persecutor;\\r\\nand was in hope of, being able to bid him defiance in a very short\\r\\ntime. Being at the head of a faction, consisting of thirty boys, most\\r\\nof them of my own age, I was determined to put their mettle to trial,\\r\\nthat I might know how far they were to be depended upon, before I put\\r\\nmy grand scheme in execution: with this view, we attacked a body of\\r\\nstout apprentices, who had taken possession of a part of the ground\\r\\nallotted to us for the scheme of our diversions, and who were then\\r\\nplaying at ninepins on the spot; but I had the mortification to see my\\r\\nadherents routed in an instant, and a leg of one of them broke in his\\r\\nflight by the bowl, which one of our adversaries had detached in\\r\\npursuit of us. This discomfiture did not hinder us from engaging them\\r\\nafterwards in frequent skirmishes, which we maintained by throwing\\r\\nstones at a distance, wherein I received many wounds, the scars of\\r\\nwhich still remain. Our enemies were so harassed and interrupted by\\r\\nthese alarms that they at last abandoned their conquest, and left us to\\r\\nthe peaceable enjoyment of our own territories.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be endless to enumerate the exploits we performed in the\\r\\ncourse of this confederacy, which became the terror of the whole\\r\\nvillage; insomuch that, when different interests divided it, one of the\\r\\nparties commonly courted the assistance of Roderick Random (by which\\r\\nname I was known) to cast the balance, and keep the opposite faction in\\r\\nawe. Meanwhile, I took the advantage of every play-day to present\\r\\nmyself before my grandfather, to whom I seldom found access, by reason\\r\\nof his being closely besieged by a numerous family of his female\\r\\ngrandchildren, who, though they perpetually quarrelled among\\r\\nthemselves, never failed to join against me, as the common enemy of\\r\\nall. His heir, who was about the age of eighteen, minded nothing but\\r\\nfox-hunting, and indeed was qualified for nothing else, notwithstanding\\r\\nhis grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s indulgence in entertaining a tutor for him at home;\\r\\nwho at the same time performed the office of parish clerk. This young\\r\\nActaeon, who inherited his grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s antipathy to everything in\\r\\ndistress, never sat eyes on me without uncoupling his beagles, and\\r\\nhunting me into some cottage or other, whither I generally fled for\\r\\nshelter. In this Christian amusement he was encouraged by his\\r\\npreceptor, who, no doubt, took such opportunities to ingratiate himself\\r\\nwith the rising sun, observing, that the old gentleman, according to\\r\\nthe course of nature, had not long to live, for he was already on the\\r\\nverge of fourscore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe behaviour of this rascally sycophant incensed me so much, that one\\r\\nday, when I was beleaguered by him and his hounds in a farmerâ\\x80\\x99s house,\\r\\nwhere I had found protection, I took aim at him (being an excellent\\r\\nmarksman) with a large pebble, which struck out four of his foreteeth,\\r\\nand effectually incapacitated him from doing the office of a clerk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Motherâ\\x80\\x99s Brother arrivesâ\\x80\\x94relieves meâ\\x80\\x94a Description of himâ\\x80\\x94he goes\\r\\nalong with me to the House of my Grandfatherâ\\x80\\x94is encountered by his\\r\\nDogsâ\\x80\\x94defeats them, after a bloody Engagementâ\\x80\\x94is admitted to the old\\r\\nGentlemanâ\\x80\\x94a Dialogue between them\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout this time my motherâ\\x80\\x99s only brother, who had been long abroad,\\r\\nlieutenant of a man-of-war, arrived in his own country; where being\\r\\ninformed of my condition, he came to see me, and out of his slender\\r\\nfinances not only supplied me with what necessaries I wanted for the\\r\\npresent, but resolved not to leave the country until he had prevailed\\r\\non my grandfather to settle something handsome for the future. This was\\r\\na task to which he was by no means equal, being entirely ignorant, not\\r\\nonly of the judgeâ\\x80\\x99s disposition, but also of the ways of men in\\r\\ngeneral, to which his education on board had kept him an utter\\r\\nstranger.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a strong built man, somewhat bandy legged, with a neck like that\\r\\nof a bull, and a face which (you might easily perceive) had withstood\\r\\nthe most obstinate assaults of the weather. His dress consisted of a\\r\\nsoldierâ\\x80\\x99s coat altered for him by the shipâ\\x80\\x99s tailor, a striped flannel\\r\\njacket, a pair of red breeches spanned with pitch, clean gray worsted\\r\\nstockings, large silver buckles that covered three-fourths of his\\r\\nshoes, a silver-laced hat, whose crown overlooked the brims about an\\r\\ninch and a half, black bobwig in buckle, a check shirt, a silk\\r\\nhandkerchief, a hanger, with a brass handle, girded to his thigh by a\\r\\nfurnished lace belt, and a good oak plant under his arm. Thus equipped,\\r\\nhe set out with me (who by his bounty made a very decent appearance)\\r\\nfor my grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s house, where we were saluted by Jowler and Caesar,\\r\\nwhom my cousin, young master, had let loose at our approach. Being well\\r\\nacquainted with the inveteracy of these curs, I was about to betake\\r\\nmyself to my heels, when my uncle seized me with one hand, brandished\\r\\nhis cudgel with the other, and at one blow laid Caesar sprawling on the\\r\\nground; but, finding himself attacked at the same time in the rear by\\r\\nJowler, and fearing Caesar might recover, he drew his hanger, wheeled\\r\\nabout, and by a lucky stroke severed Jowlerâ\\x80\\x99s head from his body. By\\r\\nthis time, the young foxhunter and three servants, armed with\\r\\npitchforks and flails, were come to the assistance of the dogs, whom\\r\\nthey found breathless upon the field; and my cousin was so provoked at\\r\\nthe death of his favourites, that he ordered his attendants to advance,\\r\\nand take vengeance on their executioner, whom he loaded with all the\\r\\ncurses and reproaches his anger could suggest. Upon which my uncle\\r\\nstepped forwards with an undaunted air, at the sight of whose bloody\\r\\nweapons his antagonists fell back with precipitation, when he accosted\\r\\ntheir leader thus:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLookee, brother, your dogs having boarded me without provocation, what\\r\\nI did was in my own defence. So you had best be civil, and let us shoot\\r\\na head, clear of you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether the young squire misinterpreted my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s desire of peace, or\\r\\nwas enraged at the fate of his hounds beyond his usual pitch of\\r\\nresolution, I know not; but he snatched a flail from one of his\\r\\nfollowers, and came up with a show of assaulting the lieutenant, who,\\r\\nputting himself in a posture of defence, proceeded thus: â\\x80\\x9cLookee, you\\r\\nlubberly son of a wâ\\x80\\x94e, if you come athwart me, â\\x80\\x99ware your gingerbread\\r\\nwork. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be foul of your quarter, dâ\\x80\\x94n me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis declaration, followed by a flourish of his hanger, seemed to check\\r\\nthe progress of the young gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s choler, who, looking behind him,\\r\\nperceived his attendants had slunk into the house, shut the gate, and\\r\\nleft him to decide the contention by himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere a parley ensued, which was introduced by my cousinâ\\x80\\x99s asking, â\\x80\\x9cWho\\r\\nthe devil are you? What do you want? Some scoundrel of a seaman, I\\r\\nsuppose, who has deserted and turned thief. But donâ\\x80\\x99t think you shall\\r\\nescape, sirrahâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have you hangâ\\x80\\x99d, you dog, I will. Your blood shall\\r\\npay for that of my two hounds, you ragamuffin. I would not have parted\\r\\nwith them to save your whole generation from the gallows, you ruffian,\\r\\nyou!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNone of your jaw, you swabâ\\x80\\x94none of your jaw,â\\x80\\x9d replied my uncle,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9celse I shall trim your laced jacket for you. I shall rub you down with\\r\\nan oaken towel, my boy, I shall.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he sheathed his hanger,\\r\\nand grasped his cudgel. Meanwhile the people of the house being\\r\\nalarmed, one of my female cousins opened a window, and asked what was\\r\\nthe matter. â\\x80\\x9cThe matter!â\\x80\\x9d answered the lieutenant; â\\x80\\x9cno great matter,\\r\\nyoung woman; I have business with the old gentleman, and this spark,\\r\\nbelike, wonâ\\x80\\x99t allow me to come alongside of him,â\\x80\\x9d thatâ\\x80\\x99s all. After a\\r\\nfew minutes pause we were admitted, and conducted to my grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nchamber through a lane of my relations, who honoured me with very\\r\\nsignificant looks as I passed along. When we came into the judgeâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npresence my uncle, after two or three sea-bows, expressed himself in\\r\\nthis manner; â\\x80\\x9cYour servant, your servant. What cheer, father? what\\r\\ncheer? I suppose you donâ\\x80\\x99t know meâ\\x80\\x94mayhap you donâ\\x80\\x99t. My name is Tom\\r\\nBowling, and this here boy, you look as if you did not know him\\r\\nneither; â\\x80\\x99tis like you maynâ\\x80\\x99t. Heâ\\x80\\x99s new rigged, iâ\\x80\\x99faith; his cloth\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t shake in the wind so much as it wont to do. â\\x80\\x99Tis my nephew, dâ\\x80\\x99y\\r\\nsee, Roderick Randomâ\\x80\\x94your own flesh and blood, old gentleman. Donâ\\x80\\x99t lay\\r\\na-stern, you dog,â\\x80\\x9d pulling me forward. My grandfather (who was laid up\\r\\nwith the gout) received this relation, after his long absence, with\\r\\nthat coldness of civility which was peculiar to him; told him he was\\r\\nglad to see him, and desired him to sit down. â\\x80\\x9cThank ye, thank ye, sir,\\r\\nI had as lief stand,â\\x80\\x9d said my uncle; â\\x80\\x9cfor my own part, I desire nothing\\r\\nof you; but, if you have any conscience at all, do something for this\\r\\npoor boy, who has been used at a very unchristian rate. Unchristian do\\r\\nI call it? I am sure the Moors in Barbary have more humanity than to\\r\\nleave their little ones to want. I would fain know why my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s son\\r\\nis more neglected than that there fair-weather Jackâ\\x80\\x9d (pointing to the\\r\\nyoung squire, who with the rest of my cousins had followed us into the\\r\\nroom). â\\x80\\x9cIs not he as near akin to you as the other? Is he not much\\r\\nhandsomer and better built than that great chucklehead? Come, come,\\r\\nconsider, old gentleman, you are going in a short time to give an\\r\\naccount of your evil actions. Remember the wrongs you did his father,\\r\\nand make all the satisfaction in your power before it be too late. The\\r\\nleast thing you can do is to settle his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s portion on him.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young ladies, who thought themselves too much concerned to contain\\r\\nthemselves any longer, set up their throats all together against my\\r\\nprotectorâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cScurvy companionâ\\x80\\x94saucy tarpaulinâ\\x80\\x94rude, impertinent fellow,\\r\\ndid he think to prescribe to grandpapa? His sisterâ\\x80\\x99s brat had been too\\r\\nwell taken care of. Grandpapa was too just not make a difference\\r\\nbetween an unnatural, rebellious son and his dutiful, loving children,\\r\\nwho took his advice in all things;â\\x80\\x9d and such expressions were vented\\r\\nagainst him with great violence; until the judge at length commanded\\r\\nsilence. He calmly rebuked my uncle for his unmannerly behaviour, which\\r\\nhe said he would excuse on account of his education: he told him he had\\r\\nbeen very kind to the boy, whom he had kept at school seven or eight\\r\\nyears, although he was informed he made no progress in his learning but\\r\\nwas addicted to all manner of vice, which he rather believed, because\\r\\nhe himself was witness to a barbarous piece of mischief he had\\r\\ncommitted on the jaws of his chaplain. But, however, he would see what\\r\\nthe lad was fit for, and bind him apprentice to some honest tradesman\\r\\nor other, provided he would mend his manners, and behave for the future\\r\\nas became him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe honest tar (whose pride and indignation boiled within him) answered\\r\\nmy grandfather, that it was true he had sent him to school, but it had\\r\\ncost him nothing, for he had never been at one shilling expense to\\r\\nfurnish him with food, raiment, books, or other necessaries; so that it\\r\\nwas not much to be wondered at, if the boy made small progress; and yet\\r\\nwhoever told him so was a lying, lubberly rascal, and deserved to be\\r\\nkeel-haulâ\\x80\\x99d; for though he (the lieutenant) did not understand those\\r\\nmatters himself, he was well informed as how Rory was the best scholar\\r\\nof his age in all the country; the truth of which he would maintain, by\\r\\nlaying a wager of his whole half-yearâ\\x80\\x99s pay on the boyâ\\x80\\x99s headâ\\x80\\x94with\\r\\nthese words he pulled out his purse, and challenged the company:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNeither is he predicted to vice, as you affirm, but rather, left like\\r\\na wreck, dâ\\x80\\x99ye see, at the mercy of the wind and weather, by your\\r\\nneglect, old gentleman. As for what happened to your chaplain, I am\\r\\nonly sorry that he did not knock out the scoundrelâ\\x80\\x99s brains instead of\\r\\nhis teeth. By the Lord, if ever I come up with him, he had better be in\\r\\nGreenland, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all. Thank you for your courteous offer of binding\\r\\nthe lad apprentice to a tradesman. I suppose you would make a tailor of\\r\\nhimâ\\x80\\x94would you? I had rather see him hangâ\\x80\\x99d, dâ\\x80\\x99ye see. Come along, Rory,\\r\\nI perceive how the land lies, my boyâ\\x80\\x94letâ\\x80\\x99s tack about, iâ\\x80\\x99faithâ\\x80\\x94while I\\r\\nhave a shilling you shanâ\\x80\\x99t want a tester. Bâ\\x80\\x99we, old gentleman; youâ\\x80\\x99re\\r\\nbound for the other world, but I believe damnably ill-provided for the\\r\\nvoyage.â\\x80\\x9d Thus ended our visit; and we returned to the village, my uncle\\r\\nmuttering curses all the way against the old shark and the young fry\\r\\nthat surrounded him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Grandfather makes his Willâ\\x80\\x94our second Visitâ\\x80\\x94he Diesâ\\x80\\x94his Will is read\\r\\nin Presence of all his living Descendantsâ\\x80\\x94the Disappointment of my\\r\\nfemale Cousinsâ\\x80\\x94my Uncleâ\\x80\\x99s Behaviour\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA few weeks after our first visit, we were informed that the old judge,\\r\\nat the end of a fit of thoughtfulness, which lasted three days, had\\r\\nsent for a notary and made his will; that the distemper had mounted\\r\\nfrom his legs to his stomach, and, being conscious of his approaching\\r\\nend, he had desired to see all his descendants without exception. In\\r\\nobedience to this summons, my uncle set out with me a second time, to\\r\\nreceive the last benediction of my grandfather: often repeating by the\\r\\nroad, â\\x80\\x9cEy, ey, we have brought up the old hulk at last. You shall\\r\\nseeâ\\x80\\x94you shall see the effect of my admonition,â\\x80\\x9d When we entered his\\r\\nchamber, which was crowded with his relations, we advanced to the\\r\\nbedside, where we found him in his last agonies, supported by two of\\r\\nhis granddaughters, who sat on each side of him, sobbing most\\r\\npiteously, and wiping away the froth and slaver as it gathered on his\\r\\nlips, which they frequently kissed with a show of great anguish and\\r\\naffection. My uncle approached him with these words, â\\x80\\x9cWhat! heâ\\x80\\x99s not\\r\\na-weigh. How fare ye? how fare ye, old gentleman? Lord have mercy upon\\r\\nyour poor sinful soul!â\\x80\\x9d Upon which, the dying man turned his languid\\r\\neyes towards us, and Mr. Bowling went onâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80\\x99s poor Roy come to see\\r\\nyou before you die, and to receive your blessing. What, man! donâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ndespair, you have been a great sinner, â\\x80\\x99tis true,â\\x80\\x94what then? Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\nrighteous judge above, anâ\\x80\\x99t there? He minds me no more than a porpoise.\\r\\nYes, yes, heâ\\x80\\x99s a-going; the land crabs will have him, I see that! his\\r\\nanchorâ\\x80\\x99s a-peak, iâ\\x80\\x99faith.â\\x80\\x9d This homely consolation scandalised the\\r\\ncompany so much, and especially the parson, who probably thought his\\r\\nprovince invaded, that we were obliged to retire into another room,\\r\\nwhere, in a few minutes, we were convinced of my grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s decease,\\r\\nby a dismal yell uttered by the young ladies in his apartment; whither\\r\\nwe immediately hastened, and found his heir, who had retired a little\\r\\nbefore into a closet, under pretence of giving vent to his sorrow,\\r\\nasking, with a countenance beslubbered with tears, if his grandpapa was\\r\\ncertainly dead? â\\x80\\x9cDead!â\\x80\\x9d (says my uncle, looking, at the body) â\\x80\\x9cay, ay,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll warrant him as dead as a herring. Oddâ\\x80\\x99s fish! now my dream is out\\r\\nfor all the world. I thought I stood upon the forecastle, and saw a\\r\\nparcel of carrion crows foul of a dead shark: that floated alongside,\\r\\nand the devil perching upon our spritsail yard, in the likeness of a\\r\\nblue bearâ\\x80\\x94who, dâ\\x80\\x99ye see jumped overboard upon the carcass and carried\\r\\nit to the bottom in his claws.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOut upon thee, reprobateâ\\x80\\x9d cries the\\r\\nparson â\\x80\\x9cout upon thee, blasphemous wretch! Dost thou think his honourâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsoul is in the possession of Satan?â\\x80\\x9d The clamour immediately arose, and\\r\\nmy poor uncle, being, shouldered from one corner of the room to the\\r\\nother, was obliged to lug out in his own defence, and swear he would\\r\\nturn out for no man, till such time as he knew who had the title to\\r\\nsend him adrift. â\\x80\\x9cNone of your tricks upon travellers,â\\x80\\x9d said he;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmayhap old Bluff has left my kinsman here his heir: if he has, it will\\r\\nbe the better for his miserable soul. Odds bob! Iâ\\x80\\x99d desire no better\\r\\nnews. Iâ\\x80\\x99d soon make him a clear shin, I warrant you.â\\x80\\x9d To avoid any\\r\\nfurther disturbance, one of my grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s executors, who was\\r\\npresent, assured Mr. Bowling, that his nephew should have all manner of\\r\\njustice; that a day should be appointed after the funeral for examining\\r\\nthe papers of the deceased, in presence of all his relations; till\\r\\nwhich time every desk and cabinet in the house should remain close\\r\\nsealed; and that he was very welcome to be witness to this ceremony,\\r\\nwhich was immediately performed to his satisfaction. In the meantime,\\r\\norders were given to provide mourning for all the relations, in which\\r\\nnumber I was included; but my uncle would not suffer me to accept of\\r\\nit, until I should be assured whether or no I had reason to honour his\\r\\nmemory so far. During this interval, the conjectures of people, with\\r\\nregard to the old gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s will, were various: as it was well known,\\r\\nhe had, besides his landed estate, which was worth Â£700 per annum, six\\r\\nor seven thousand pounds at interest, some imagined that the whole real\\r\\nestate (which he had greatly improved) would go to the young man whom\\r\\nhe always entertained as his heir; and that the money would be equally\\r\\ndivided between my female cousins (five in number) and me. Others were\\r\\nof opinion, that, as the rest of the children had been already provided\\r\\nfor, he would only bequeath two or three hundred pounds to each of his\\r\\ngranddaughters, and leave the bulk of the sum to me, to atone for his\\r\\nunnatural usage of my father. At length the important hour arrived, and\\r\\nthe will was produced in the midst of the expectants, whose looks and\\r\\ngestures formed a group that would have been very entertaining to an\\r\\nunconcerned spectator. But, the reader can scarce conceive the\\r\\nastonishment and mortification that appeared, when an attorney\\r\\npronounced aloud, the young squire sole heir of all his grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nestate, personal and real. My uncle, who had listened with great\\r\\nattention, sucking the head of his cudgel all the while, accompanied\\r\\nthese words of the attorney with a stare, and whew, that alarmed the\\r\\nwhole assembly. The eldest and pertest of my female competitors, who\\r\\nhad been always very officious about my grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s person, inquired,\\r\\nwith a faltering accent and visage as yellow as an orange, â\\x80\\x9cif there\\r\\nwere no legacies?â\\x80\\x9d and was answered, â\\x80\\x9cNone at all.â\\x80\\x9d Upon which she\\r\\nfainted away. The rest, whose expectations, perhaps, were not so\\r\\nsanguine, supported their disappointment with more resolution, though\\r\\nnot without giving evident marks of indignation, and grief at least as\\r\\ngenuine as that which appeared in them at the old gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s death. My\\r\\nconductor, after having kicked with his heel for some time against the\\r\\nwainscot, began: â\\x80\\x9cSo thereâ\\x80\\x99s no legacy, friend, ha!â\\x80\\x94hereâ\\x80\\x99s an old\\r\\nsuccubus; but somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s soul howls for it, dâ\\x80\\x94n me!â\\x80\\x9d The parson of the\\r\\nparish, who was one of the executors, and had acted as ghostly director\\r\\nto the old man, no sooner heard this exclamation than he cried out,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAvaunt, unchristian reviler! avaunt! wilt thou not allow the soul of\\r\\nhis honour to rest in peace?â\\x80\\x9d But this zealous pastor did not find\\r\\nhimself so warmly seconded, as formerly, by the young ladies, who now\\r\\njoined my uncle against him, and accused him of having acted the part\\r\\nof a busybody with their grandpapa whose ears he had certainly abused\\r\\nby false stories to their prejudice, or else he would not have\\r\\nneglected them in such an unnatural manner. The young squire was much\\r\\ndiverted with this scene, and whispered to my uncle, that if he had not\\r\\nmurdered his dogs, he would have shown him glorious fun, by hunting a\\r\\nblack badger (so he termed the clergyman). The surly lieutenant, who\\r\\nwas not in a humour to relish this amusement, replied, â\\x80\\x9cYou and your\\r\\ndogs may be damnâ\\x80\\x99d. I suppose youâ\\x80\\x99ll find them with your old dad, in\\r\\nthe latitude of hell. Come, Rory,â\\x80\\x94about ship, my lad, we must steer\\r\\nanother course, I think.â\\x80\\x9d And away we went.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Schoolmaster uses me barbarouslyâ\\x80\\x94I form a Project of Revenge, in\\r\\nwhich I am assisted by my Uncleâ\\x80\\x94I leave the Villageâ\\x80\\x94am settled at a\\r\\nUniversity by his Generosity\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn our way back to the village, my uncle spoke not a word during the\\r\\nspace of a whole hour, but whistled with great vehemence the tune of\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy should we quarrel for riches,â\\x80\\x9d etc. his visage being contracted\\r\\nall the while into a most formidable frown. At length his pace\\r\\nincreased to such a degree that I was left behind a considerable way:\\r\\nthen he waited for me; and when I was almost up with him, called out in\\r\\na surly tone, â\\x80\\x9cBear a hand, damme! must I bring to every minute for\\r\\nyou, you lazy dog.â\\x80\\x9d Then, laying hold of me by the arm, hauled me\\r\\nalong, until his good nature (of which he had a great share) and\\r\\nreflection getting the better of his he said, â\\x80\\x9cCome, my boy, donâ\\x80\\x99t be\\r\\ncast down,â\\x80\\x94the old rascal is in hell, thatâ\\x80\\x99s some satisfaction; you\\r\\nshall go to sea with me, my lad. A light heart and a thin pair of\\r\\nbreeches goes through the world, brave boys, as the song goesâ\\x80\\x94eh!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThough this proposal did not at all suit my inclination, I was afraid\\r\\nof discovering my aversion to it, lest I should disoblige the only\\r\\nfriend I had in the world; and he was so much a seaman that he never\\r\\ndreamt I could have had any objection to his design; consequently gave\\r\\nhimself no trouble in consulting my approbation. But this resolution\\r\\nwas soon dropped, by the device of our usher, who assured Mr. Bowling,\\r\\nit would be a thousand pities to balk my genius, which would certainly\\r\\none day make my fortune on shore, provided it received due cultivation.\\r\\nUpon which, this generous tar determined (though he could ill afford\\r\\nit) to give me university education; and accordingly settled my board\\r\\nand other expenses, at a town not many miles distant, famous for its\\r\\ncolleges, whither we repaired in a short time. But, before the day of\\r\\nour departure, the schoolmaster, who no longer had the fear of my\\r\\ngrandfather before his eyes, laid aside all decency and restraint, and\\r\\nnot only abused me in the grossest language his rancour could suggest,\\r\\nas a wicked, profligate, dull, beggarly miscreant, whom he had taught\\r\\nout of charity; but also inveighed in the most bitter manner against\\r\\nthe memory of the judge (who by the by had procured that settlement for\\r\\nhim), hinting, in pretty plain terms, that the old gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s soul was\\r\\ndamned to all eternity for his injustice in neglecting to pay for my\\r\\nlearning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis brutal behaviour, added to the sufferings I had formerly undergone\\r\\nmade me think it high time to be revenged on this insolent pedagogue.\\r\\nHaving consulted my adherents, I found them all staunch in their\\r\\npromises to stand by me; and our scheme was this:â\\x80\\x94In the afternoon\\r\\npreceding to the day of our departure for the University, I resolved to\\r\\ntake the advantage of the usherâ\\x80\\x99s going out to make water (which he\\r\\nregularly did at four oâ\\x80\\x99clock), and shut the great door, that he might\\r\\nnot come to the assistance of his superior. This being done, the\\r\\nassault was to be begun by my advancing to my master and spitting in\\r\\nhis face. I was to be seconded by two of the strongest boys in the\\r\\nschool, who were devoted to me; their business was to join me in\\r\\ndragging the tyrant to a bench, over which he was to be laid, and his\\r\\nbare posteriors heartily flogged, with his own birch, which we proposed\\r\\nto wrest from him in his struggle; but if we should find him too many\\r\\nfor us all three, we were to demand the assistance of our competitors,\\r\\nwho should be ready to enforce us, or oppose anything that might be\\r\\nundertaken for the masterâ\\x80\\x99s relief. One of my principal assistants was\\r\\ncalled Jeremy Gawky, son and heir of a wealthy gentleman in the\\r\\nneighbourhood; and the name of the other, Hugh Strap, the cadet of a\\r\\nfamily which had given shoemakers to the village time out of mind. I\\r\\nhad once saved Gawkyâ\\x80\\x99s life, by plunging into a river and dragging him\\r\\non shore, when he was on the point of being drowned. I had often\\r\\nrescued him from the clutches of those whom his insufferable arrogance\\r\\nhad provoked to a resentment he was not able to sustain; and many times\\r\\nsaved his reputation and posteriors, by performing his exercises at\\r\\nschool; so that it is not to be wondered at, if he had a particular\\r\\nregard for me and my interests. The attachment of Strap flowed from a\\r\\nvoluntary, disinterested inclination, which had manifested itself on\\r\\nmany occasions in my behalf, he having once rendered me the same\\r\\nservice that I had rendered Gawky, by saving my life at the risk of his\\r\\nown; and often fathered offences that I had committed, for which he\\r\\nsuffered severely, rather than I should feel the weight of the\\r\\npunishment. These two champions were the more willing to engage in this\\r\\nenterprise, because they intended to leave the school next day, as well\\r\\nas I; the first being ordered by his father to return into the country,\\r\\nand the other being bound apprentice to his barber, at a market town\\r\\nnot far off.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, my uncle, being informed of my masterâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour to\\r\\nme, was enraged at his insolence, and vowed revenge so heartily that I\\r\\ncould not refrain from telling him the scheme I had concerted, while he\\r\\nheard with great satisfaction, at every sentence squirting out a\\r\\nmouthful of spittle, tinctured with tobacco, of which he constantly\\r\\nchewed a large quid. At last, pulling up his breeches, he cried, â\\x80\\x9cNo,\\r\\nno, zâ\\x80\\x94ds! that wonâ\\x80\\x99t do neither; howsoever, â\\x80\\x99tis a bold undertaking, my\\r\\nlad, that I must say, iâ\\x80\\x99faith; but lookee, lookee, how do you propose\\r\\nto get clear offâ\\x80\\x94wonâ\\x80\\x99t the enemy give chase, my boy?â\\x80\\x94ay, ay, that he\\r\\nwill, I warrant, and alarm the whole coast; ah! God help thee, more\\r\\nsail than ballast, Rory. Let me alone for thatâ\\x80\\x94leave the whole to me.\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll show him the foretopsail, I will. If so be your shipmates are\\r\\njolly boys, and wonâ\\x80\\x99t flinch, you shall see, you shall see; egad, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nplay him such a salt-water trick Iâ\\x80\\x99ll bring him to the gangway and\\r\\nanoint him with a cat-and-nine-tails; he shall have a round dozen\\r\\ndoubled, my lad, he shallâ\\x80\\x94and be left lashed to his meditations.â\\x80\\x9d We\\r\\nwere very proud of our associate, who immediately went to work, and\\r\\nprepared the instrument of his revenge with great skill and expedition;\\r\\nafter which, he ordered our baggage to be packed up and sent off, a day\\r\\nbefore our attempt, and got horses ready to be mounted, as soon as the\\r\\naffair should be over. At length the hour arrived, when our auxiliary,\\r\\nseizing the opportunity of the usherâ\\x80\\x99s absence, bolted in, secured the\\r\\ndoor, and immediately laid hold of the pedant by his collar who bawled\\r\\nout, â\\x80\\x9cMurder, Thieves,â\\x80\\x9d with the voice of a Stentor. Though I trembled\\r\\nall over like an aspen leaf, I knew there was no time to be lost, and\\r\\naccordingly got up, and summoned our associates to our assistance.\\r\\nStrap, without any hesitation, obeyed the signal, and seeing me leap\\r\\nupon the masterâ\\x80\\x99s back, ran immediately to one of his legs, which\\r\\npulling with all his force, this dreadful adversary was humbled to the\\r\\nground; upon which Gawky, who had hitherto remained in his place, under\\r\\nthe influence of a universal trepidation, hastened to the scene of\\r\\naction, and insulted the fallen tyrant with a loud huzza, in which the\\r\\nwhole school joined. The noise alarmed the usher, who, finding himself\\r\\nshut out, endeavoured, partly by threats and partly by entreaties, to\\r\\nprocure admission. My uncle bade him have a little patience, and he\\r\\nwould let him in presently; but if he pretended to stir from that\\r\\nplace, it should fare the worse with the son of a bitch his superior,\\r\\non whom he intended only to bestow a little wholesome chastisement, for\\r\\nhis barbarous usage of Rory, â\\x80\\x9cto which,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cyou are no\\r\\nstranger.â\\x80\\x9d By this time we had dragged the criminal to a post, to which\\r\\nBowling tied him with a rope he had provided on purpose; after having\\r\\nsecured his hands and stripped his back. In this ludicrous posture he\\r\\nstood (to the no small entertainment of the boys, who crowded about\\r\\nhim, and shouted with great exultation at the novelty of the sight),\\r\\nventing bitter imprecations against the lieutenant, and reproaching his\\r\\nscholars with treachery and rebellion; when the usher was admitted,\\r\\nwhom my uncle accosted in this manner: â\\x80\\x9cHarkee, Mr. Syntax, I believe\\r\\nyou are an honest man, dâ\\x80\\x99ye seeâ\\x80\\x94and I have a respect for youâ\\x80\\x94but for\\r\\nall that, we must, for our own security, dâ\\x80\\x99ye see, belay you for a\\r\\nshort time.â\\x80\\x9d With these words, he pulled out some fathoms of cord,\\r\\nwhich the honest man no sooner saw than he protested with great\\r\\nearnestness he would allow no violence to be offered to him, at the\\r\\nsame time accusing me of perfidy and ingratitude. But Bowling\\r\\nrepresenting that it was in vain to resist, and that he did not mean to\\r\\nuse him with violence and indecency, but only to hinder him from\\r\\nraising the hue and cry against us before we should be out of their\\r\\npower, he allowed himself to be bound to his own desk, where he sat a\\r\\nspectator of the punishment inflicted on his principal. My uncle,\\r\\nhaving upbraided this arbitrary wretch with his inhumanity to me, told\\r\\nhim, that he proposed to give him a little discipline for the good of\\r\\nhis soul, which he immediately put in practice, with great vigour and\\r\\ndexterity. This smart application to the pedantâ\\x80\\x99s withered posteriors\\r\\ngave him such exquisite pain that he roared like a mad bull, danced,\\r\\ncursed, and blasphemed, like a frantic bedlamite. When the lieutenant\\r\\nthought himself sufficiently revenged, he took his leave of him in\\r\\nthese words: â\\x80\\x9cNow, friend, youâ\\x80\\x99ll remember me the longest day you have\\r\\nto live; I have given you a lesson that will let you know what flogging\\r\\nis, and teach you to have more sympathy for the future. Shout, boys,\\r\\nshout!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ceremony was no sooner over than my uncle proposed they should\\r\\nquit the school, and convey their old comrade Rory to the public-house,\\r\\nabout a mile from the village, where he would treat them all. His offer\\r\\nbeing joyfully embraced, he addressed himself to Mr. Syntax, and begged\\r\\nhim to accompany us; but this invitation he refused with great disdain,\\r\\ntelling my benefactor he was not the man he took him to be. â\\x80\\x9cWell,\\r\\nwell, old surly,â\\x80\\x9d replied my uncle, shaking his hand, â\\x80\\x9cthou art an\\r\\nhonest fellow notwithstanding; and if ever I have the command of a\\r\\nship, thou shalt be our schoolmaster, iâ\\x80\\x99faith.â\\x80\\x9d So saying he dismissed\\r\\nthe boys, and locking the door, left the two preceptors to console one\\r\\nanother; while we moved forwards on our journey, attended by a numerous\\r\\nretinue, whom he treated according to his promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe parted with many tears, and lay that night at an inn on the road,\\r\\nabout ten miles short of the town where I was to remain, at which we\\r\\narrived next day, and I found I had no cause to complain of the\\r\\naccommodations provided for me, in being boarded at the house of an\\r\\napothecary, who had married a distant relation of my mother. In a few\\r\\ndays after, my uncle set out for his ship, having settled the necessary\\r\\nfunds for my maintenance and education.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI make great progress in my Studiesâ\\x80\\x94am caressed by Everybodyâ\\x80\\x94my female\\r\\nCousins take notice of meâ\\x80\\x94I reject their Invitationâ\\x80\\x94they are incensed,\\r\\nand conspire against meâ\\x80\\x94am left destitute by a Misfortune that befalls\\r\\nmy Uncleâ\\x80\\x94Gawkyâ\\x80\\x99s Treacheryâ\\x80\\x94my Revenge\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was now capable of reflection, I began to consider my precarious\\r\\nsituation; that I was utterly abandoned by those whose duty it was to\\r\\nprotect me: and that my sole dependence was on the generosity of one\\r\\nman, who was not only exposed by his profession to continual dangers,\\r\\nwhich might one day deprive me of him for ever; but also (no doubt)\\r\\nsubject to those vicissitudes of disposition which a change of fortune\\r\\nusually creates, or which a better acquaintance with the world might\\r\\nproduce; for I always ascribed his benevolence to the dictates of a\\r\\nheart as yet undebauched by a commerce with mankind. Alarmed at these\\r\\nconsiderations, I resolved to apply myself with great care to my\\r\\nstudies, and enjoy the opportunity in my power: this I did with such\\r\\nsuccess that, in the space of three years, I understood Greek very\\r\\nwell, was pretty far advanced in the mathematics, and no stranger to\\r\\nmoral and natural philosophy: logic I made no account of; but, above\\r\\nall things, I valued myself on my taste in the belles lettres, and a\\r\\ntalent for poetry, which had already produced some pieces that had met\\r\\nwith a favourable reception. These qualifications, added to a good face\\r\\nand shape, acquired the esteem and acquaintance of the most\\r\\nconsiderable people in town, and I had the satisfaction to find myself\\r\\nin some degree of favour with the ladies; an intoxicating piece of good\\r\\nfortune to one of my amorous complexion! which I obtained, or at least\\r\\npreserved, by gratifying their propensity to scandal, in lampooning\\r\\ntheir rivals.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo of my female cousins lived in this place, with their mother, since\\r\\nthe death of their father, who left his whole fortune equally divided\\r\\nbetween them; so that, if they were not the most beautiful, they were\\r\\nat least the richest toasts in town; and received daily the addresses\\r\\nof all the beaux and cavaliers of the country. Although I had hitherto\\r\\nbeen looked upon by them with the most supercilious contempt, my\\r\\ncharacter now attracted their notice so much that I was given to\\r\\nunderstand I might be honoured with their acquaintance, if I pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reader will easily perceive that this condescension either flowed\\r\\nfrom the hope of making my poetical capacity subservient to their\\r\\nmalice, or at least of screening themselves from the lash of my\\r\\nresentment, which they had effectually provoked. I enjoyed this triumph\\r\\nwith great satisfaction, and not only rejected their offer with\\r\\ndisdain, but in all my performances, whether satire or panegyric,\\r\\nindustriously avoided mentioning their names, even while I celebrated\\r\\nthose of their intimates: this neglect mortified their pride\\r\\nexceedingly and incensed them to such a degree that they were resolved\\r\\nto make me repent of my indifference. The first stroke of their revenge\\r\\nconsisted in their hiring a poor collegian to write verses against me,\\r\\nthe subject of which was my own poverty, and the catastrophe of my\\r\\nunhappy parents; but, besides the badness of the composition (of which\\r\\nthey themselves were ashamed), they did not find their account in\\r\\nendeavouring to reproach me with those misfortunes which they and their\\r\\nrelations had brought upon me; and which consequently reflected much\\r\\nmore dishonour on themselves than on me, who was the innocent victim of\\r\\ntheir barbarity and avarice.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding this plan miscarry, they found means to irritate a young\\r\\ngentleman against me, by telling him I had lampooned his mistress; and\\r\\nso effectually succeeded in the quality of incendiaries that this\\r\\nenraged lover determined to seize me next night as I returned to my\\r\\nlodgings from a friendâ\\x80\\x99s house that I frequented: with this view, he\\r\\nwaited in the street, attended by two of his companions, to whom he had\\r\\nimparted his design of carrying me down to the river, in which proposed\\r\\nto have me heartily ducked, notwithstanding the severity of the\\r\\nweather, it being then about the middle of December. But this stratagem\\r\\ndid not succeed; for, being apprised of their ambush, I got home\\r\\nanother way, and by the help of my landlordâ\\x80\\x99s apprentice, discharged a\\r\\nvolley from the garret window, which did great execution upon them, and\\r\\nnext day occasioned so much mirth at their expense that they found\\r\\nthemselves under a necessity of leaving the town, until the adventure\\r\\nshould be entirely forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cousins (though twice baffled in their expectation) did not,\\r\\nhowever, desist from persecuting me, who had now enraged them beyond a\\r\\npossibility of forgiveness by detecting their malice and preventing its\\r\\neffects: neither should I have found them more humane, had I patiently\\r\\nsubmitted to their rancour, and borne without murmuring the rigour of\\r\\ntheir unreasonable hate; for I have found by experience, that though\\r\\nsmall favours may be acknowledged and slight injuries atoned, there is\\r\\nno wretch so ungrateful as he whom you have most generously obliged,\\r\\nand no enemy so implacable as those who have done you the greatest\\r\\nwrong. These good-natured creatures, therefore, had recourse to a\\r\\nscheme which conspired with a piece of bad news I soon after received,\\r\\nto give them all the satisfaction they desired: this plan was to\\r\\ndebauch the faith of my companion and confidant, who betrayed the trust\\r\\nI reposed in him, by imparting to them the particulars of my small\\r\\namours, which they published with such exaggerations that I suffered\\r\\nvery much in the opinion of everybody, and was utterly discarded by the\\r\\ndear creatures whose names had been called in question.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I was busy in tracing out the author of this treachery, that I\\r\\nmight not only be revenged on him, but also vindicate my character to\\r\\nmy friends, I one day perceived the looks of my landlady much altered,\\r\\nwhen I went home to my dinner, and inquiring into the cause, she\\r\\nscrewed up her mouth, and fixed her eyes on the ground, told me her\\r\\nhusband had received a letter from Mr. Bowling, with one inclosed for\\r\\nme. She was very sorry for what had happened, both for my sake and his\\r\\nownâ\\x80\\x94people should be more cautious of their conductâ\\x80\\x94she was always\\r\\nafraid his brutal behaviour would bring him into some misfortune or\\r\\nother. As for her part, she should be very ready to befriend me; but\\r\\nshe had a small family of her own to maintain. The world would do\\r\\nnothing for her if she should come to wantâ\\x80\\x94charity begins at home: she\\r\\nwished I had been bound to some substantial handicraft, such as a\\r\\nweaver or a shoemaker, rather than loiter away my time in learning\\r\\nfoolish nonsense, that would never bring me in a penny but some folks\\r\\nare wise, and some are otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was listening to this mysterious discourse with great amazement, when\\r\\nher husband entered, and, without speaking a syllable, put both the\\r\\nletters into my hand. I received them trembling, and read what follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98To Mr. Roger Potion\\r\\n    â\\x80\\x98Sir,\\r\\n    â\\x80\\x98This is to let you know that I have quitted the Thunder man of\\r\\n    war, being obliged to sheer off for killing my captain, which I did\\r\\n    fairly on the beach, at Cape Tiberoon, in the Island of Hispaniola;\\r\\n    having received his fire and returned it, which went through his\\r\\n    body: and I would serve the best man so that ever stepped between\\r\\n    stem and stern, if so be that he struck me, as Captain Oakum did. I\\r\\n    am (thank God) safe among the French, who are very civil, though I\\r\\n    donâ\\x80\\x99t understand their lingo; and I hope to be restored in a little\\r\\n    time, for all the great friends and parliamentary interest of the\\r\\n    captain, for I have sent over to my landlord in Deal an account of\\r\\n    the whole affair, with our bearings and distances while we were\\r\\n    engaged, whereby I have desired him to lay it before his majesty,\\r\\n    who (God bless him) will not suffer an honest tar to be wronged. My\\r\\n    love to your spouse, and am\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Your loving friend and servant to command, while\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thomas Bowling,â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98To Roderick Random\\r\\n    â\\x80\\x98Dear Rory,\\r\\n    â\\x80\\x98Donâ\\x80\\x99t be grieved at my misfortune, but mind your book, my lad. I\\r\\n    have got no money to send you, but what of that? Mr. Potion will\\r\\n    take care of you for the love he bears to me, and let you want for\\r\\n    nothing; and it shall go hard but I will see him one day repaid. No\\r\\n    more at present, but rests\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Your dutiful uncle and servant, till death,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Thomas Bowling.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter (which, with the other, was dated from Port Louis, in\\r\\nHispaniola) I had no sooner read than the apothecary, shaking his head,\\r\\nbegan: â\\x80\\x9cI have a very great regard for Mr. Bowling thatâ\\x80\\x99s certain; and\\r\\ncould be well contentâ\\x80\\x94but times are very hard. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no such thing as\\r\\nmoney to be got; I believe â\\x80\\x99tis all vanished under ground, for my part.\\r\\nBesides, I have been out of pocket already, having entertained you\\r\\nsince the beginning of this month, without receiving a sixpence, and\\r\\nGod knows if ever I shall; for I believe it will go hard with your\\r\\nuncle. And more than that, I was thinking of giving you warning, for I\\r\\nwant your apartment for a new prentice, whom I expect from the country\\r\\nevery hour. So I desire you will this week provide yourself with\\r\\nanother lodging.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe indignation which this harangue inspired gave me spirits to support\\r\\nmy reverse of fortune, and to tell him I despised his mean selfish\\r\\ndisposition so much that I would rather starve than be beholden to him\\r\\nfor one single meal. Upon which, out of my pocket money, I paid him to\\r\\nthe last farthing of what I owed, and assured him, I would not sleep\\r\\nanother night under his roof.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis said, I sallied out in a transport of rage and sorrow, without\\r\\nknowing whither to fly for shelter, having not one friend in the world\\r\\ncapable of relieving me, and only three shillings in my purse. After\\r\\ngiving way for a few minutes to the dictates of my rage, I went and\\r\\nhired a small bedroom, at the rate of one shilling and sixpence per\\r\\nweek, which I was obliged to pay per advance, before the landlord would\\r\\nreceive me: thither I removed my luggage; and next morning got up, with\\r\\na view of craving the advice and assistance of a person who had on all\\r\\noccasions loaded me with caresses and made frequent offers of\\r\\nfriendship, while I was under no necessity of accepting them. He\\r\\nreceived me with his wonted affability, and insisted on my breakfasting\\r\\nwith him, a favour which I did not think fit to refuse. But when I\\r\\ncommunicated the occasion of my visit, he appeared so disconcerted that\\r\\nI concluded him wonderfully affected with the misery of my condition\\r\\nand looked upon him as a man of the most extensive sympathy and\\r\\nbenevolence. He did not leave me long under this mistake; for,\\r\\nrecovering himself from his confusion, he told me he was grieved at my\\r\\nmisfortune, and desired to know what had passed between my landlord,\\r\\nMr. Potion, and me. Whereupon I recounted the conversation; and, when I\\r\\nrepeated the answer I made to his ungenerous remonstrance with regard\\r\\nto my leaving his house, this pretended friend affected a stare, and\\r\\nexclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cIs it possible you could behave so ill to the man who had\\r\\ntreated you so kindly all along?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy surprise at hearing this was not at all affected, whatever his might\\r\\nbe; and I gave to understand with some warmth, that I did not imagine\\r\\nhe would so unreasonably espouse the cause of a scoundrel who ought to\\r\\nbe expelled from every social community. This heat of mine gave him all\\r\\nthe advantage he desired over me, and our discourse, after much\\r\\naltercation, concluded in his desiring never to see me again in that\\r\\nplace; to which desire I yielded my consent, assuring him, that, had I\\r\\nbeen as well acquainted with his principles formerly as I was now, he\\r\\nnever should have had an opportunity of making that request. And thus\\r\\nwe parted.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn my return, I met my comrade, Squire Gawky, whom his father had sent,\\r\\nsome time ago, to town, for his improvement in writing, dancing,\\r\\nfencing, and other modish qualifications. As I had lived with him since\\r\\nhis arrival on the footing of our old intimacy, I made no scruple of\\r\\ninforming him of the lowness of my circumstances, and asking a small\\r\\nsupply of money, to answer my present expense; upon which he pulled out\\r\\na handful of halfpence with a shilling or two among them, and swore\\r\\nthat was all he had to keep his pocket till next quarter-day he having\\r\\nlost the greatest part of his allowance the night before at billiards.\\r\\nThough this assertion might very well be true, I was extremely\\r\\nmortified at his indifference: for he neither expressed any sympathy\\r\\nfor my mishap nor desire of alleviating my distress; and accordingly I\\r\\nleft him without uttering one word: but, when I afterwards understood\\r\\nthat he was the person who had formerly betrayed me to the malice of my\\r\\ncousins, to whom likewise he had carried the tidings of my forlorn\\r\\nsituation, which afforded them great matter of triumph and exultation,\\r\\nI determined with myself to call him to a severe account for which\\r\\npurpose I borrowed a sword, and wrote a challenge, desiring him to meet\\r\\nme at a certain time and place, that I might have an opportunity of\\r\\npunishing his perfidy, at the expense of his blood. He accepted the\\r\\ninvitation, and I betook myself to the field, though not without\\r\\nfeeling considerable repugnance to the combat, which frequently\\r\\nattacked me in cold sweats by the way; but the desire of revenge, the\\r\\nshame of retracting, and hope of conquest, conspired to repel these\\r\\nunmanly symptoms of fear; and I appeared on the plain with a good\\r\\ngrace: there I waited an hour beyond the time appointed, and was not\\r\\nill pleased to find he had no mind to meet me, because I should have an\\r\\nopportunity of exposing his cowardice, displaying my own courage, and\\r\\nof beating him soundly wheresoever I should find, without any dread of\\r\\nthe consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nElevated with these suggestions, which entirely banished all thoughts\\r\\nof my deplorable condition, I went directly to Gawkyâ\\x80\\x99s lodgings, where\\r\\nI was informed of his precipitate retreat, he having set out for the\\r\\ncountry in less than an hour after he had received my billet; and I was\\r\\nvain enough to have the whole story inserted in the news, although I\\r\\nwas fain to sell a gold laced hat to my landlord for less than\\r\\nhalf-price, to defray the expenses and contribute to my subsistence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI am entertained by Mr. Crabâ\\x80\\x94a description of himâ\\x80\\x94I acquire the Art of\\r\\nSurgeryâ\\x80\\x94consult Crabâ\\x80\\x99s Dispositionâ\\x80\\x94become necessary to himâ\\x80\\x94an Accident\\r\\nhappensâ\\x80\\x94he advises me to launch out into the worldâ\\x80\\x94assists me with\\r\\nMoneyâ\\x80\\x94I set out for London\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fumes of my resentment being dissipated, as well as the vanity of\\r\\nmy success, I found myself deserted to all the horrors of extreme want,\\r\\nand avoided by mankind as a creature of a different species, or rather\\r\\nas a solitary being, noways comprehended within the scheme or\\r\\nprotection of Providence. My despair had rendered me almost quite\\r\\nstupified, when I was one day told, that a gentleman desired to see me\\r\\nat a certain public-house, whither immediately I repaired; and was\\r\\nintroduced to one Mr. Launcelot Crab, a surgeon in town, who was\\r\\nengaged with two more in drinking a liquor called pop-in, composed by\\r\\nmixing a quartern of brandy with a quart of small beer. Before I relate\\r\\nthe occasion of this message, I believe it will not be disagreeable to\\r\\nthe reader, if I describe the gentleman who sent for me, and mention\\r\\nsome circumstances of his character and conduct which may illustrate\\r\\nwhat follows, and account for his behaviour to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis member of the faculty was aged fifty, about five feet high, and\\r\\nten round the belly; his face was as capacious as a full moon, and much\\r\\nof the complexion of a mulberry: his nose, resembling a powder-horn,\\r\\nwas swelled to an enormous size, and studded all over with carbuncles;\\r\\nand his little gray eyes reflected the rays in such an oblique manner\\r\\nthat, while he looked a person full in the face, one would have\\r\\nimagined he was admiring the buckle of his shoe. He had long\\r\\nentertained an implacable resentment against Potion, who, though a\\r\\nyounger practitioner, was better employed than he, and once had the\\r\\nassurance to perform a cure, whereby he disappointed and disgraced the\\r\\nprognostic of the said Crab. This quarrel which was at one time upon\\r\\nthe point of being made up, by the interposition and mediation of\\r\\nfriends, had been lately inflamed beyond a possibility of\\r\\nreconciliation by the respective wives of the opponents, who, chancing\\r\\nto meet at a christening, disagreed about precedence, proceeded from\\r\\ninvectives to blows, and were with great difficulty, by the gossips,\\r\\nprevented from converting the occasion of joy into a scene of\\r\\nlamentation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difference between these rivals was in the height of rancour, when\\r\\nI received the message of Crab, who received me as civilly as I could\\r\\nhave expected from one of his disposition; and, after desiring me to\\r\\nsit, inquired into the particulars of my leaving the house of Potion;\\r\\nwhich when I had related, he said, with a malicious grin, â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\nsneaking dog! I always thought him a fellow without a soul, dâ\\x80\\x94n me, a\\r\\ncanting scoundrel, who has crept into business by his hypocrisy, and\\r\\nkissing the aâ\\x80\\x94e of every body.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cAy, ay,â\\x80\\x9d says another, â\\x80\\x9cone might see\\r\\nwith half an eye that the rascal has no honesty in him, by his going so\\r\\nregularly to church.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sentence was confirmed by a third, who assured his companions that\\r\\nPotion was never known to be disguised in liquor but once, at a meeting\\r\\nof the godly, where he had distinguished himself by an extempore prayer\\r\\nan hour long. After this preamble, Crab addressed himself to me in\\r\\nthese words: â\\x80\\x9cWell, my lad, I have heard a good character of you, and\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll do for you. You may send your things to my house when you please.\\r\\nI have given orders for your reception. Zounds! What does the booby\\r\\nstare at? If you have no mind to embrace my courteous offer, you may\\r\\nlet it alone, and be dâ\\x80\\x94d.â\\x80\\x9d I answered with a submissive bow, that I was\\r\\nfar from rejecting his friendly offer, which I would immediately\\r\\naccept, as soon as he should inform me on what footing I was to be\\r\\nentertained. â\\x80\\x9cWhat footing! Dâ\\x80\\x94n my blood,â\\x80\\x9d cried he, â\\x80\\x9cdâ\\x80\\x99ye expect to\\r\\nhave a footman and a couple of horses kept for you?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo, sir,â\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\nreplied, â\\x80\\x9cmy expectations are not quite so sanguine. That I may be as\\r\\nlittle burthensome as possible, I would willingly serve in your shop,\\r\\nby which means I may save you the expense of a journeyman, or porter at\\r\\nleast, for I understand a little pharmacy, having employed some of my\\r\\nleisure hours in the practice of that art, while I lived with Mr.\\r\\nPotion; neither am I altogether ignorant of surgery, which I have\\r\\nstudied with great pleasure and application.â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cOho! you did,â\\x80\\x9d says\\r\\nCrab. â\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, here is a complete artist! Studied surgery! What? in\\r\\nbooks, I suppose. I shall have you disputing with me one of these days\\r\\non points of my profession. You can already account for muscular\\r\\nmotion, I warrant, and explain the mystery of the brain and nervesâ\\x80\\x94ha!\\r\\nYou are too learned for me, dâ\\x80\\x94n me. But letâ\\x80\\x99s have no more of this\\r\\nstuff. Can you blood and give a clyster, spread a plaster, and prepare\\r\\na potion?â\\x80\\x9d Upon my answering in the affirmative, he shock his head,\\r\\ntelling me, he believed he should have little good of me, for all my\\r\\npromises; but, however, he would take me in for the sake of charity. I\\r\\nwas accordingly that very night admitted to his house, and had an\\r\\napartment assigned to me in the garret, which I was fain to put up\\r\\nwith, notwithstanding the mortification my pride suffered in this\\r\\nchange of circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was soon convinced of the real motives which induced Crab to receive\\r\\nme in this manner; for, besides the gratification of his revenge, by\\r\\nexposing the selfishness of his antagonist, in opposition to his own\\r\\ngenerosity, which was all affectation, he had occasion for a young man\\r\\nwho understood something of the profession, to fill up the place of his\\r\\neldest apprentice, lately dead, not without violent suspicion of foul\\r\\nplay from his masterâ\\x80\\x99s brutality. The knowledge of this circumstance,\\r\\ntogether with his daily behaviour to his wife and the young apprentice,\\r\\ndid not at all contribute to my enjoying my new situation with ease;\\r\\nhowever, as I did not perceive how I could bestow myself to better\\r\\nadvantage, I resolved to study Crabâ\\x80\\x99s temper with all the application,\\r\\nand manage it with all the address in my power. And it was not long\\r\\nbefore I found out a strange peculiarity of humour which governed his\\r\\nbehaviour towards all his dependents. I observed, when he was pleased,\\r\\nhe was such a niggard of his satisfaction that, if his wife or servants\\r\\nbetrayed the least symptom of participation, he was offended to an\\r\\ninsupportable degree of choler and fury, the effects of which they\\r\\nseldom failed to feel. And when his indignation was roused, submission\\r\\nand soothing always exasperated it beyond the bounds of reason and\\r\\nhumanity. I therefore pursued a contrary plan; and one day, when he\\r\\nhonoured me with the names of ignorant whelp and lazy ragamuffin, I\\r\\nboldly replied, I was neither ignorant nor lazy, since I both\\r\\nunderstood and performed my business as well as he could do for his\\r\\nsoul; neither was it just to call me ragamuffin, for I had a whole coat\\r\\non my back, and was descended from a better family than any he could\\r\\nboast an alliance with.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave tokens of great amazement at this assurance of mine, and shook\\r\\nhis cane over my head, regarding me all the time with a countenance\\r\\ntruly diabolical. Although I was terribly startled at his menacing\\r\\nlooks and posture, I yet had reflection enough left to convince me I\\r\\nhad gone too far to retract, and that this was the critical minute\\r\\nwhich must decide my future lot in his service; I therefore snatched up\\r\\nthe pestle of a mortar, and swore, if he offered to strike me without a\\r\\ncause, I should see whether his skull or my weapon was hardest.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe continued silent for some time, and at last broke forth into these\\r\\nejaculations: â\\x80\\x9cThis is fine usage from a servant to his masterâ\\x80\\x94very\\r\\nfine! damnation! but no matter, you shall pay for this, you dog, you\\r\\nshall; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do your businessâ\\x80\\x94yes, yes, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll teach you to lift your hand\\r\\nagainst me.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he retired, and left me under dreadful\\r\\napprehensions, which vanished entirely at our next meeting, when he\\r\\nbehaved with unusual complacency, and treated me with a glass of punch\\r\\nafter dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this conduct I got the ascendancy over him in a short time, and\\r\\nbecame so necessary to him, in managing his business while he was\\r\\nengaged at the bottle, that fortune began to wear a kinder aspect; and\\r\\nI consoled myself for the disregard of my former acquaintance, with the\\r\\nknowledge I daily imbibed by a close application to the duties of my\\r\\nemployment, in which I succeeded beyond my own expectation. I was on\\r\\nvery good terms with my masterâ\\x80\\x99s wife, whose esteem I acquired and\\r\\ncultivated, by representing Mrs. Potion in the most ridiculous lights\\r\\nmy satirical talents could invent, as well as by rendering her some\\r\\nChristian offices, when she had been too familiar with the dram bottle,\\r\\nto which she had oftentimes recourse for consolation, under the\\r\\naffliction she suffered from a barbarous husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this manner I lived, without hearing the least tidings of my uncle\\r\\nfor the space of two years, during which time I kept little or no\\r\\ncompany, being neither in a humour to relish nor in a capacity to\\r\\nmaintain much acquaintance; for the Nabal my master allowed me no\\r\\nwages, and the small perquisites of my station scarcely supplied me\\r\\nwith the common necessaries of life. I was no longer a pert unthinking\\r\\ncoxcomb, giddy with popular applause, and elevated with the\\r\\nextravagance of hope: my misfortunes had taught me how little the\\r\\ncaresses of the world, during a manâ\\x80\\x99s prosperity, are to be valued by\\r\\nhim; and how seriously and expeditiously he ought to set about making\\r\\nhimself independent of them. My present appearance, therefore, was the\\r\\nleast of my care, which was wholly engrossed in laying up a stock of\\r\\ninstruction that might secure me against the caprice of fortune for the\\r\\nfuture. I became such a sloven, and contracted such an air of\\r\\nausterity, that everybody pronounced me crestfallen; and Gawky returned\\r\\nto town without running any risk from my resentment, which was by this\\r\\ntime pretty much cooled, and restrained by prudential reasons so\\r\\neffectually that I never so much as thought of obtaining satisfaction\\r\\nfor the injuries he had done me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I deemed myself sufficiently master of my business I began to cast\\r\\nabout for an opportunity of launching into the world, in hope of\\r\\nfinding some provision that might make amends for the difficulties I\\r\\nhad undergone; but, as this could not be effected without a small sum\\r\\nof money to equip me for the field, I was in the utmost perplexity how\\r\\nto raise it, well knowing that Crab, for his own sake, would never put\\r\\nme in a condition to leave him, when his interest was so much concerned\\r\\nin my stay. But a small accident, which happened about this time,\\r\\ndetermined him in my favour. This was no other than the pregnancy of\\r\\nhis maidservant, who declared her situation to me, assuring me at the\\r\\nsame time that I was the occasion of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I had no reason to question the truth of this imputation, I\\r\\nwas not ignorant of the familiarities which had passed between her\\r\\nmaster and her, taking the advantage of which I represented to her the\\r\\nfolly of laying the burden at my door, when she might dispose of it to\\r\\nmuch better purpose with Mr. Crab. She listened to my advice, and next\\r\\nday acquainted him with the pretended success of their mutual\\r\\nendeavours. He was far from being overjoyed at this proof of his\\r\\nvigour, which he foresaw might have very troublesome consequences; not\\r\\nthat he dreaded any domestic grumblings and reproaches from his wife,\\r\\nwhom he kept in perfect subjection; but because he knew it would\\r\\nfurnish his rival Potion with a handle for insulting and undermining\\r\\nhis reputation, there being no scandal equal to that of uncleanness, in\\r\\nthe opinion of those who inhabit the part of the island where he lived.\\r\\nHe therefore took a resolution worthy of himself, which was, to\\r\\npersuade the girl that she was not with child, but only afflicted with\\r\\na disorder incidental to young women, which he could easily remove:\\r\\nwith this view (as he pretended) he prescribed for her such medicines\\r\\nas he thought would infallibly procure abortion; but in this scheme he\\r\\nwas disappointed, for the maid, being advertised by me of his design,\\r\\nand at the same time well acquainted with her own condition, absolutely\\r\\nrefused to follow his directions; and threatened to publish her\\r\\nsituation to the world if he would not immediately take some method of\\r\\nproviding for the important occasion, which she expected in a few\\r\\nmonths. It was not long before I guessed the result of his\\r\\ndeliberation, by his addressing himself to me one day in this manner:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am surprised that a young fellow like you discovers no inclination\\r\\nto push his fortune in the world. Before I was of your age I was\\r\\nbroiling on the coast of Guinea. Dâ\\x80\\x94e! whatâ\\x80\\x99s to hinder you from\\r\\nprofiting by the war which will certainly be declared in a short time\\r\\nagainst Spain? You may easily get on board of a kingâ\\x80\\x99s ship in quality\\r\\nof surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s mate, where you will certainly see a great deal of\\r\\npractice, and stand a good chance of getting prize-money.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI laid hold of this declaration, which I had long wished for, and\\r\\nassured him I would follow his advice with pleasure, if it were in my\\r\\npower; but that it was impossible for me to embrace an opportunity of\\r\\nthat kind, as I had no friend to advance a little money to supply me\\r\\nwith what necessaries I should want, and defray the expenses of my\\r\\njourney to London. He told me that few necessaries were required; and,\\r\\nas for the expense of my journey, he would lend me money, sufficient\\r\\nnot only for that purpose, but also to maintain me comfortably in\\r\\nLondon until I should procure a warrant for my provision on board of\\r\\nsome ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave him a thousand thanks for his obliging offer (although I was\\r\\nvery well apprised of his motive, which was no other than a design to\\r\\nlay the bastard to my charge after my departure), and accordingly set\\r\\nout in a few weeks for London; my whole fortune consisting of one suit\\r\\nof clothes, half a dozen ruffled shirts, as many plain, two pair of\\r\\nworsted and a like number of threaded stockings; a case of pocket\\r\\ninstruments, a small edition of Horace, Wisemanâ\\x80\\x99s Surgery, and ten\\r\\nguineas in cash; for which Crab took my bond, bearing five per cent\\r\\ninterest; at the same time giving me a letter to a member of parliament\\r\\nfor our town, which he said would do my business effectually.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI arrive at Newcastleâ\\x80\\x94meet with my old Schoolfellow Strapâ\\x80\\x94we determine\\r\\nto walk together to Londonâ\\x80\\x94set out on our Journeyâ\\x80\\x94put up at a solitary\\r\\nAlehouseâ\\x80\\x94are disturbed by a strange Adventure in the Night\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no such convenience as a waggon in this country, and my\\r\\nfinances were too weak to support the expense of hiring a horse: I\\r\\ndetermined therefore to set out with the carriers, who transport goods\\r\\nfrom one place to another on horseback; and this scheme I accordingly\\r\\nput in execution on the 1st day of September, 1739, sitting upon a\\r\\npack-saddle between two baskets, one of which contained my goods in a\\r\\nknapsack. But by the time we arrived at Newcastle-upon-Tyne I was so\\r\\nfatigued with the tediousness of the carriage, and benumbed with the\\r\\ncoldness of the weather, that I resolved to travel the rest of my\\r\\njourney on foot, rather than proceed in such a disagreeable manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ostler of the inn at which we put up, understanding I was bound for\\r\\nLondon, advised me to take my passage in a collier which would be both\\r\\ncheap and expeditious and withal much easier than to walk upwards of\\r\\nthree hundred miles through deep roads in the winter time, a journey\\r\\nwhich he believed I had not strength enough to perform. I was almost\\r\\npersuaded to take his advice, when one day, stepping into a barberâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nshop to be shaved, the young man, while he lathered my face, accosted\\r\\nme thus: â\\x80\\x9cSir, I presume you are a Scotchman.â\\x80\\x9d I answered in the\\r\\naffirmative. â\\x80\\x9cPray,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, â\\x80\\x9cfrom what part of Scotland?â\\x80\\x9d I no\\r\\nsooner told him, than he discovered great emotion, and not confining\\r\\nhis operation to my chin and upper lip, besmeared my whole face with\\r\\ngreat agitation. I was so offended at this profusion that starting up,\\r\\nI asked him what the dâ\\x80\\x94l he meant by using me so? He begged pardon,\\r\\ntelling me his joy at meeting with a countryman had occasioned some\\r\\nconfusion in him, and craved my name. But, when I declared my name was\\r\\nRandom, he exclaimed in rapture, â\\x80\\x9cHow! Rory Random?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe same,â\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\nreplied, looking at him with astonishment. â\\x80\\x9cWhat!â\\x80\\x9d cried he, â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\nknow your old schoolfellow, Hugh Strap?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that instant recollecting his face, I flew into his arms, and in the\\r\\ntransport of my joy, gave him back one-half of the suds he had so\\r\\nlavishly bestowed on my countenance; so that we made a very ludicrous\\r\\nappearance, and furnished a great deal of mirth for his master and\\r\\nshopmates, who were witnesses of this scene. When our mutual caresses\\r\\nwere over I sat down again to be shaved, but the poor fellowâ\\x80\\x99s nerves\\r\\nwere so discomposed by this unexpected meeting that his hand could\\r\\nscarcely hold the razor, with which, nevertheless, he found means to\\r\\ncut me in three places in as many strokes. His master, perceiving his\\r\\ndisorder, bade another supply his place, and after the operation was\\r\\nperformed, gave Strap leave to pass the rest of the day with me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe retired immediately to my lodgings, where, calling for some beer, I\\r\\ndesired to be informed of his adventures, which contained nothing more\\r\\nthan that his master dying before his time was out, he had come to\\r\\nNewcastle about a year ago, in expectation of journeywork, along with\\r\\nthree young fellows of his acquaintance who worked in the keels; that\\r\\nhe had the good fortune of being employed by a very civil master, with\\r\\nwhom he intended to stay till the spring, at which time he proposed to\\r\\ngo to London, where he did not doubt of finding encouragement. When I\\r\\ncommunicated to him my situation and design, he did not approve of my\\r\\ntaking a passage by sea, by reason of the danger of a winter voyage,\\r\\nwhich is very hazardous along that coast, as well as the precariousness\\r\\nof the wind, which might possibly detain me a great while, to the no\\r\\nsmall detriment of my fortune; whereas, if I would venture by land, he\\r\\nwould bear me company, carry my baggage all the way, and if we should\\r\\nbe fatigued before we could perform the journey it would be no hard\\r\\nmatter for us to find on the road either return horses or waggons, of\\r\\nwhich we might take the advantage for a very trifling expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so ravished at this proposal that I embraced him affectionately,\\r\\nand assured him he might command my purse to the last farthing; but he\\r\\ngave me to understand he had saved money sufficient to answer his own\\r\\noccasions; and that he had a friend in London who would soon introduce\\r\\nhim into business in that capital, and possibly have it in his power to\\r\\nserve me also.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving concerted the plan and settled our affairs that night, we\\r\\ndeparted next morning by daybreak, armed with a good cudgel each (my\\r\\ncompanion being charged with the furniture of us both crammed into one\\r\\nknapsack), and our money sewed between the linings and waistbands of\\r\\nour breeches, except some loose silver for our immediate expenses on\\r\\nthe road, We travelled all day at a round pace, but, being ignorant of\\r\\nthe proper stages, were benighted at a good distance from any inn, so\\r\\nthat we were compelled to take up our lodging at a small hedge\\r\\nalehouse, that stood on a byroad, about half-a-mile from the highway:\\r\\nthere we found a pedlar of our own country, in whose company we regaled\\r\\nourselves with bacon and eggs, and a glass of good ale, before a\\r\\ncomfortable fire, conversing all the while very sociably with the\\r\\nlandlord and his daughter, a hale buxom lass, who entertained us with\\r\\ngreat good humour, and in whose affection I was vain enough to believe\\r\\nI had made some progress. About eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock we were all three, at our\\r\\nown desire, shown into an apartment furnished with two beds, in one of\\r\\nwhich Strap and I betook ourselves to rest, and the pedlar occupied the\\r\\nother, though not before he had prayed a considerable time extempore,\\r\\nsearched into every corner of the room, and fastened the door on the\\r\\ninside with a strong iron screw, which he carried about with him for\\r\\nthat use.\\r\\n\\r\\nI slept very sound till midnight when I was disturbed by a violent\\r\\nmotion of the bed, which shook under me with a continual tremor.\\r\\nAlarmed at this phenomenon, I jogged my companion, whom, to my no small\\r\\namazement, I found drenched in sweat, and quaking through every limb;\\r\\nhe told me, with a low faltering voice, that we were undone; for there\\r\\nwas a bloody highwayman, loaded with pistols, in the next room; then,\\r\\nbidding me make as little noise as possible, he directed me to a small\\r\\nchink in the board partition through which I could see a thick-set\\r\\nbrawny fellow, with a fierce countenance, sitting at a table with our\\r\\nyoung landlady, having a bottle of ale and a brace of pistols before\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nI listened with great attention, and heard him say, in a terrible tone,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n that son of a bâ\\x80\\x94h, Smack the coachman; he has served me a fine\\r\\ntrick, indeed! but dâ\\x80\\x94ion seize me, if I donâ\\x80\\x99t make him repent it! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nteach the scoundrel to give intelligence to others while he is under\\r\\narticles with me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOur landlady endeavoured to appease this exasperated robber, by saying\\r\\nhe might be mistaken in Smack, who perhaps kept no correspondence with\\r\\nthe other gentleman that robbed his coach; and that, if an accident had\\r\\ndisappointed him to-day, he might soon find opportunities enough to\\r\\natone for his lost trouble. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell thee what, my dear Bet,â\\x80\\x9d replied\\r\\nhe, â\\x80\\x9cI never had, nor ever shall, while my name is Rifle, have such a\\r\\nglorious booty as I missed to-day. Zâ\\x80\\x94s! there was Â£400 in cash to\\r\\nrecruit men for the kingâ\\x80\\x99s service, besides the jewels, watches,\\r\\nswords, and money belonging to the passengers. Had it been my fortune\\r\\nto have got clear off with so much treasure, I would have purchased a\\r\\ncommission in the army, and made you an officerâ\\x80\\x99s lady, you jade, I\\r\\nwould.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell, well,â\\x80\\x9d cries Betty, â\\x80\\x9cwe must trust to Providence for\\r\\nthat. But did you find nothing worth taking which escaped the other\\r\\ngentlemen of the road?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNot much, faith,â\\x80\\x9d said the lover; â\\x80\\x9cI gleaned a\\r\\nfew things, such as a pair of pops, silver mounted (here they are): I\\r\\ntook them loaded from the captain who had the charge of the money,\\r\\ntogether with a gold watch which he had concealed in his breeches. I\\r\\nlikewise found ten Portugal pieces in the shoes of a quaker, whom the\\r\\nspirit moved to revile me with great bitterness and devotion; but what\\r\\nI value myself mostly for is, this here purchase, a gold snuffbox, my\\r\\ngirl, with a picture on the inside of the lid; which I untied out of\\r\\nthe tail of a pretty ladyâ\\x80\\x99s smock.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, as the devil would have it, the pedlar snored so loud, that the\\r\\nhighwayman, snatching his pistols, started up, crying, â\\x80\\x9cHell and d-n-n!\\r\\nI am betrayed! Whoâ\\x80\\x99s that in the next room?â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Betty told him he\\r\\nneed not be uneasy: there were only three poor travellers, who, missing\\r\\nthe road, had taken up their lodgings in the house, and were asleep\\r\\nlong ago. â\\x80\\x9cTravellers,â\\x80\\x9d says he, â\\x80\\x9cspies, you bâ\\x80\\x94ch! But no matter; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nsend them all to hell in an instant!â\\x80\\x9d He accordingly ran towards our\\r\\ndoor; when his sweetheart interposing, assured him, there was only a\\r\\ncouple of poor young Scotchmen, who were too raw and ignorant to give\\r\\nhim the least cause of suspicion; and the third was a presbyterian\\r\\npedlar of the same nation, who had often lodged in the house before.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis declaration satisfied the thief, who swore he was glad there was a\\r\\npedlar, for he wanted some linen. Then, in a jovial manner, he put\\r\\nabout the glass, mingling his discourse to Betty with caresses and\\r\\nfamiliarities, that spoke him very happy in his amours. During that\\r\\npart of the conversation which regarded this, Strap had crept under the\\r\\nbed, where he lay in the agonies of fear; so that it was with great\\r\\ndifficulty I persuaded him our danger was over, and prevailed on him to\\r\\nawake the pedlar, and inform him of what he had seen and heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe itinerant merchant no sooner felt somebody shaking him by the\\r\\nshoulder, than he started up, called, as loud as he could, â\\x80\\x9cThieves,\\r\\nthieves! Lord have mercy upon us!â\\x80\\x9d And Rifle, alarmed at this\\r\\nexclamation, jumped up, cocked one of his pistols, and turned towards\\r\\nthe door to kill the first man that should enter; for he verily\\r\\nbelieved himself beset: when his Dulcinea, after an immoderate fit of\\r\\nlaughter, persuaded him that the poor pedlar, dreaming of thieves, had\\r\\nonly cried out in his sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, my comrade had undeceived our fellow-lodger, and informed\\r\\nhim of his reason for disturbing him; upon which, getting up softly, he\\r\\npeeped through the hole, and was so terrified with what he saw, that,\\r\\nfalling down on his bare knees, he put up a long petition to Heaven to\\r\\ndeliver him from the hands of that ruffian, and promised never to\\r\\ndefraud a customer for the future of the value of a pinâ\\x80\\x99s point,\\r\\nprovided he might be rescued from the present danger. Whether or not\\r\\nhis disburthening his conscience afforded him any ease I knew not, but\\r\\nhe slipped into bed again, and lay very quiet until the robber and his\\r\\nmistress were asleep, and snored in concert; then, rising softly, he\\r\\nuntied a rope that was round his pack, which making fast to one end of\\r\\nit, he opened the window with as little noise as possible, and lowered\\r\\nhis goods into the yard with great dexterity: then he moved gently to\\r\\nour bedside and bade us farewell, telling us that, as we ran no risk we\\r\\nmight take our rest with great confidence, and in the morning assure\\r\\nthe landlord that we knew nothing of his escape, and, lastly, shaking\\r\\nus by the hands, and wishing us all manner of success, he let himself\\r\\ndrop from the window without any danger, for the ground was not above a\\r\\nyard from his feet as he hung on the outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I did not think proper to accompany him in his flight, I was\\r\\nnot at all free from apprehension when I reflected on what might be the\\r\\neffect of the highwaymanâ\\x80\\x99s disappointment; as he certainly intended to\\r\\nmake free with the pedlarâ\\x80\\x99s ware. Neither was my companion at more ease\\r\\nin his mind, but on the contrary, so possessed with the dreadful idea\\r\\nof Rifle, that he solicited me strongly to follow our countrymanâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nexample, and so elude the fatal resentment of that terrible adventurer,\\r\\nwho would certainly wreak his vengeance on us as accomplices of the\\r\\npedlarâ\\x80\\x99s elopement. But I represented to him the danger of giving Rifle\\r\\ncause to think we know his profession, and suggested that, if ever he\\r\\nshould meet us again on the road, he would look upon us as dangerous\\r\\nacquaintance, and find it his interest to put us out of the way. I told\\r\\nhim, withal, my confidence in Bettyâ\\x80\\x99s good nature, in which he\\r\\nacquiesced; and during the remaining part of the night we concerted a\\r\\nproper method of behaviour, to render us unsuspected in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was no sooner day than Betty, entering our chamber, and perceiving\\r\\nour window open, cried out, â\\x80\\x9cOdds-bobs! sure you Scotchmen must have\\r\\nhot constitutions to lie all night with the window open in such cold\\r\\nweather.â\\x80\\x9d I feigned to start out of sleep, and, withdrawing the\\r\\ncurtain, called, â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?â\\x80\\x9d When she showed me, I affected\\r\\nsurprise, and said, â\\x80\\x9cBless me! the window was shut when we went to\\r\\nbed.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll be hanged,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cif Sawney Waddle, the pedlar, has\\r\\nnot got up in a dream and done it, for I heard him very obstropulous in\\r\\nhis sleep.â\\x80\\x94Sure I put a chamberpot under his bed!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these words she advanced to the bed, in which he lay, and, finding\\r\\nthe sheets cold, exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cGood lackadaisy! The rogue is fled.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFled,â\\x80\\x9d cried I, with feigned amazement, â\\x80\\x9cGod forbid! Sure he has not\\r\\nrobbed us!â\\x80\\x9d Then, springing up, I laid hold of my breeches, and emptied\\r\\nall my loose money into my hand; which having reckoned, I said, â\\x80\\x9cHeaven\\r\\nbe praised, our money is all safe! Strap, look to the knapsack.â\\x80\\x9d He did\\r\\nso, and found all was right. Upon which we asked, with seeming concern,\\r\\nif he had stolen nothing belonging to the house. â\\x80\\x9cNo, no,â\\x80\\x9d replied she,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9che has stole nothing but his reckoning;â\\x80\\x9d which, it seems, this pious\\r\\npedlar had forgot to discharge in the midst of his devotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetty, after a momentâ\\x80\\x99s pause withdrew, and immediately we could hear\\r\\nher waken Rifle, who no sooner heard of Waddleâ\\x80\\x99s flight than he jumped\\r\\nout of bed and dressed, venting a thousand execrations, and vowing to\\r\\nmurder the pedlar if ever he should set eyes on him again: â\\x80\\x9cFor,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nhe â\\x80\\x9cthe scoundrel has by this time raised the hue and cry against me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving dressed himself in a hurry, he mounted his horse, and for that\\r\\ntime rid us of his company and a thousand fears that were the\\r\\nconsequence of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we were at breakfast, Betty endeavoured, by all the cunning she\\r\\nwas mistress of, to learn whether or no we suspected our fellow-lodger,\\r\\nwhom we saw take horse; but, as we were on our guard, we answered her\\r\\nsly questions with a simplicity she could not distrust; when, all of a\\r\\nsudden, we heard the trampling of a horseâ\\x80\\x99s feet at the door. This\\r\\nnoise alarmed Strap so much, whose imagination was wholly engrossed by\\r\\nthe image of Rifle, that, with a countenance as pale as milk, he cried,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cO Lord! there is the highwayman returned!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOur landlady, staring at these words, said, â\\x80\\x9cWhat highwayman, young\\r\\nman? Do you think any highwaymen harbour here?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThough I was very much disconcerted at this piece of indiscretion in\\r\\nStrap, I had presence of mind enough to tell her we had met a horseman\\r\\nthe day before, whom Strap had foolishly supposed to be a highwayman,\\r\\nbecause he rode with pistols; and that he had been terrified at the\\r\\nsound of a horseâ\\x80\\x99s feet ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe forced a smile at the ignorance and timidity of my comrade; but I\\r\\ncould perceive, not without great concern, that this account was not at\\r\\nall satisfactory to her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe proceed on our Journeyâ\\x80\\x94are overtaken by a Highwayman who fires at\\r\\nStrapâ\\x80\\x94is prevented from shooting me by a Company of Horsemen, who ride\\r\\nin pursuit of himâ\\x80\\x94Strap is put to Bed at an Innâ\\x80\\x94Adventures at that Inn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having paid our score and taken leave of our hostess, who\\r\\nembraced me tenderly at parting, we proceeded on our journey, blessing\\r\\nourselves that we had come off so well. We had not walked above five\\r\\nmiles, when we observed a man on horseback galloping after us, whom we\\r\\nin a short time recognised to be no other than this formidable hero who\\r\\nhad already given us so much vexation. He stopped hard by me, and asked\\r\\nif I knew who he was? My astonishment had disconcerted me so much that\\r\\nI did not hear his question, which he repeated with a volley of oaths\\r\\nand threats; but I remained as mute as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrap, seeing my discomposure, fell upon his knees in the mud,\\r\\nuttering, with a lamentable voice, these words: â\\x80\\x9cFor Christâ\\x80\\x99s sake,\\r\\nhave mercy upon us, Mr. Rifle! we know you very well.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOho!â\\x80\\x9d cried the\\r\\nthief, â\\x80\\x9cyou do! But you never shall be evidence against me in this\\r\\nworld, you dog!â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he drew a pistol, and fired it at the\\r\\nunfortunate shaver, who fell flat upon the ground without speaking one\\r\\nword.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy comradeâ\\x80\\x99s fate and my own situation riveted me to the place where I\\r\\nstood, deprived of all sense and reflection; so that I did not make the\\r\\nleast attempt either to run away or deprecate the wrath of this\\r\\nbarbarian, who snapped a second pistol at me; but, before he had time\\r\\nto prime again, perceiving a company of horsemen coming up, he rode\\r\\noff, and left me standing motionless as a statue, in which posture I\\r\\nwas found by those whose appearance had saved my life. This company\\r\\nconsisted of three men in livery, well armed, with an officer, who (as\\r\\nI afterwards learned,) was the person from whom Rifle had taken the\\r\\npocket pistols the day before; and who, making known his misfortune to\\r\\na nobleman he met on the road, and assuring him his non-resistance was\\r\\naltogether owing to his consideration for the ladies in the coach,\\r\\nprocured the assistance of his lordshipâ\\x80\\x99s servants to go in quest of\\r\\nthe plunderer. This holiday captain scampered up to me with great\\r\\naddress, and asked who fired the pistol which he had heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I had not yet recovered my reason, he, before I could answer,\\r\\nobserved a body lying on the ground, at which sight his colour changed,\\r\\nand he pronounced, with a faltering tongue, â\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, hereâ\\x80\\x99s murder\\r\\ncommitted! Let us alight.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo, no,â\\x80\\x9d said one of his followers, â\\x80\\x9clet us\\r\\nrather pursue the murderer. Which way went he, young man?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time I had recollected myself so far as to tell them that he\\r\\ncould not be a quarter of a mile before; and to beg one of them to\\r\\nassist me in conveying the corpse of my friend to the next house, in\\r\\norder to it being interred. The captain, foreseeing that, in case he\\r\\nshould pursue, he must soon come to action, began to curb his horse,\\r\\nand gave him the spur at the same time, which treatment making the\\r\\ncreature rear up and snort, he called out, his horse was frightened,\\r\\nand would not proceed; at the same time wheeling him round and round,\\r\\nstroking his neck, whistling and wheedling him with â\\x80\\x9cSirrah,\\r\\nsirrahâ\\x80\\x94gently, gently.â\\x80\\x9d etc. â\\x80\\x9cZâ\\x80\\x94ds!â\\x80\\x9d, cried one of the servants, â\\x80\\x9csure\\r\\nmy lordâ\\x80\\x99s Sorrel is not resty!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these words he bestowed a lash on his buttocks, and Sorrel,\\r\\ndisdaining the rein sprang forward with the captain at a pace that\\r\\nwould have soon brought him up with the robber, had not the girtle\\r\\n(happily for him) given way, by which means he landed in the dirt; and\\r\\ntwo of his attendants continued their pursuit, without minding his\\r\\nsituation. Meanwhile one of the three who remained at my desire,\\r\\nturning the body of Strap, in order to see the wound which had killed\\r\\nhim, found him still warm and breathing: upon which, I immediately let\\r\\nhim blood, and saw him, with inexpressible joy, recover; he having\\r\\nreceived no other wound than what his fear had inflicted. Having raised\\r\\nhim upon his legs, we walked together to an inn, about half a mile from\\r\\nthe place, where Strap, who was not quite recovered, went to bed; and\\r\\nin a little time the third servant returned with the captainâ\\x80\\x99s horse\\r\\nand furniture, leaving him to crawl after as well as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis gentleman of the sword, upon his arrival, complained grievously of\\r\\nthe bruise occasioned by his fall; and, on the recommendation of the\\r\\nservant, who warranted my ability, I was employed to bleed him, for\\r\\nwhich service he rewarded me with half-a-crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time between this event and dinner I passed in observing a game at\\r\\ncards between two farmers, an exciseman, and a young fellow in a rusty\\r\\ngown and cassock, who, as I afterwards understood, was curate of a\\r\\nneighbouring parish. It was easy to perceive that the match was not\\r\\nequal; and that the two farmers, who were partners, had to do with a\\r\\ncouple of sharpers, who stripped them of all their cash in a very short\\r\\ntime. But what surprised me very much, was to hear this clergyman reply\\r\\nto one of the countrymen, who seemed to suspect foul play, in these\\r\\nwords: â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n me, friend, dâ\\x80\\x99ye question my honour?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not at all wonder to find a cheat in canonicals, this being a\\r\\ncharacter frequent in my own country; but I was scandalised at the\\r\\nindecency of his behaviour, which appeared in the oaths he swore, and\\r\\nthe bawdy songs which he sung. At last, to make amends in some sort,\\r\\nfor the damage he had done to the unwary boors, he pulled out a fiddle\\r\\nfrom the lining of his gown, and, promising to treat them at dinner,\\r\\nbegan to play most melodiously, singing in concert all the while. This\\r\\ngood humour of this parson inspired the company with so much glee that\\r\\nthe farmers soon forgot their losses, and all present went to dancing\\r\\nin the yard.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we were agreeably amused in this manner, our musician, spying a\\r\\nhorseman a riding towards the inn, stopped all of a sudden, crying out,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGad so! gentlemen, I beg your pardon, thereâ\\x80\\x99s our dog of a doctor\\r\\ncoming into the inn.â\\x80\\x9d He immediately commended his instrument, and ran\\r\\ntowards the gate, where he took hold of the vicarâ\\x80\\x99s bridle, and helped\\r\\nhim off, inquiring very cordially into the state of his health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rosy son of the church, who might be about the age of fifty,\\r\\nhaving alighted and entrusted the curate with his horse, stalked with\\r\\ngreat solemnity, into the kitchen, where sitting down by the fire, he\\r\\ncalled for a bottle of ale and a pipe; scarce deigning an answer to the\\r\\nsubmissive questions of those who inquired about the welfare of his\\r\\nfamily. While he indulged himself in this state, amidst a profound\\r\\nsilence, the curate, approaching him with great reverence, asked him if\\r\\nhe would not be pleased to honour him with his company at dinner? To\\r\\nwhich interrogation he answered in the negative, saying, he had been to\\r\\nvisit Squire Bumpkin, who had drank himself into a high fever at the\\r\\nlast assizes; and that he had, on leaving his own house, told Betty he\\r\\nshould dine at home. Accordingly when he had made an end of his bottle\\r\\nand pipe, he rose, and moved with prelatical dignity to the door, where\\r\\nhis journeyman stood ready with his nag. He had no sooner mounted than\\r\\nthe facetious curate, coming into the kitchen, held forth in this\\r\\nmanner: â\\x80\\x9cThere the old rascal goes, and the dâ\\x80\\x94l go with him. You see\\r\\nhow the world wags, gentlemen. By gad, this rogue of a vicar does not\\r\\ndeserve to live; and yet he has two livings worth four hundred pounds\\r\\nper annum, while poor I am fain to do all his drudgery, and ride twenty\\r\\nmiles every Sunday to preachâ\\x80\\x94for what? why, truly, for twenty pounds a\\r\\nyear. I scorn to boast of my own qualifications butâ\\x80\\x94comparisons are\\r\\nodious. I should be glad to know how this wag-bellied doctor deserves\\r\\nto be more at ease than me. He can loll in his elbow chair at home,\\r\\nindulge himself in the best of victuals and wine and enjoy the\\r\\nconversation of Betty, his housekeeper. You understand me, gentlemen.\\r\\nBetty is the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s poor kinswoman, and a pretty girl she is; but no\\r\\nmatter for that; ay, and dutiful girl to her parents, whom she visits\\r\\nregularly every year, though I must own I could never learn in what\\r\\ncounty they live, My service tâ\\x80\\x99ye, gentlemen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time dinner being ready, I waked my companion, and we ate\\r\\naltogether with great cheerfulness. When our meal was ended, and every\\r\\nmanâ\\x80\\x99s share of the reckoning adjusted, the curate went out on pretence\\r\\nof some necessary occasion, and, mounting his house, left the two\\r\\nfarmers to satisfy the host in the best manner they could. We were no\\r\\nsooner informed of this piece of finesse, than the exciseman, who had\\r\\nbeen silent hitherto, began to open with a malicious grin: â\\x80\\x9cAy, ay this\\r\\nis an old trick of Shuffle; I could not help smiling when he talked of\\r\\ntreating. You must know this is a very curious fellow. He picked up\\r\\nsome scraps of learning while he served young Lord Trifte at the\\r\\nuniversity. But what he most excels in is pimping. No one knows his\\r\\ntalents better than I, for I was valet-de-chambre to Squire Tattle an\\r\\nintimate companion of Shuffleâ\\x80\\x99s lord. He got him self into a scrape by\\r\\npawning some of his lordshipâ\\x80\\x99s clothes on which account he was turned\\r\\naway; but, as he was acquainted with some particular circumstances of\\r\\nmy lordâ\\x80\\x99s conduct, he did not care to exasperate him too much, and so\\r\\nmade interest for his receiving orders, and afterwards recommended him\\r\\nto the curacy which he now enjoys. However, the fellow cannot be too\\r\\nmuch admired for his dexterity in making a comfortable livelihood, in\\r\\nspite of such a small allowance. You hear he plays a good stick, and is\\r\\nreally diverting company; these qualifications make him agreeable\\r\\nwherever he goes; and, as for playing at cards there is not a man\\r\\nwithin three counties for him. The truth is, he is a dâ\\x80\\x94able cheat, and\\r\\ncan shift a card with such address that it is impossible to discover\\r\\nhim.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere he was interrupted by one of the farmers, who asked, why he had\\r\\nnot justice enough to acquaint them with these particulars before they\\r\\nengaged in play. The exciseman replied, without any hesitation, that it\\r\\nwas none of his business to intermeddle between man and man; besides,\\r\\nhe did not know they were ignorant of Shuffleâ\\x80\\x99s character, which was\\r\\nnotorious to the whole country. This did not satisfy the other, who\\r\\ntaxed him with abetting and assisting the curateâ\\x80\\x99s knavery, and\\r\\ninsisted on having his share of the winnings returned; this demand the\\r\\nexciseman as positively refused affirming that, whatever sleights\\r\\nShuffle might practise on other occasions, he was very certain that he\\r\\nhad played on the square with them, and would answer it before any\\r\\nbench in Christendom; so saying, he got up and, having paid his\\r\\nreckoning, sneaked off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Landlord, thrusting his neck into the passage to see if he was\\r\\ngone, shook his head, saying, â\\x80\\x9cAh! Lord help us! if every sinner was to\\r\\nhave his deserts. Well, we victuallers must not disoblige the\\r\\nexcisemen. But I know what; if parson Shuffle and he were weighed\\r\\ntogether, a straw thrown into either scale would make the balance kick\\r\\nthe beam. But, masters, this is under the rose,â\\x80\\x9d continued Boniface\\r\\nwith a whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Highwayman is takenâ\\x80\\x94we are detained as Evidence against himâ\\x80\\x94proceed\\r\\nto the next villageâ\\x80\\x94he escapesâ\\x80\\x94we arrive at another inn, where we go to\\r\\nBedâ\\x80\\x94in the Night we are awaked by a dreadful Adventureâ\\x80\\x94next night we\\r\\nlodge at the house of a Schoolmasterâ\\x80\\x94our Treatment there\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStrap and I were about to depart on our journey, when we perceived a\\r\\ncrowd on the road coming towards us, shouting and hallooing all the\\r\\nway. As it approached, we could discern a man on horseback in the\\r\\nmiddle, with his hands tied behind him, whom we soon knew to be Rifle.\\r\\nThe highwayman, not being so well mounted as the two servants who went\\r\\nin pursuit of him, was soon overtaken, and, after having discharged his\\r\\npistols, made prisoner without any further opposition. They were\\r\\ncarrying him in triumph, amidst the acclamations of the country people,\\r\\nto a justice of peace in a neighbouring village, but stopped at our inn\\r\\nto join their companions and take refreshment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Rifle was dismounted and placed in the yard, within a circle of\\r\\npeasants, armed with pitchforks, I was amazed to see what a pitiful\\r\\ndejected fellow he now appeared, who had but a few hours before filled\\r\\nme with such terror and confusion. My companion was so much encouraged\\r\\nby this alteration in his appearance that, going up to the thief, he\\r\\npresented his clenched fists to his nose, and declared he would either\\r\\ncudgel or box with the prisoner for a guinea, which he immediately\\r\\nproduced, and began to strip, but was dissuaded from this adventure by\\r\\nme, who represented to him the folly of the undertaking, as Rifle was\\r\\nnow in the hands of justice, which would, no doubt, give us all\\r\\nsatisfaction enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what made me repent of our impertinent curiosity was our being\\r\\ndetained by the captors, as evidence against him, when we were just\\r\\ngoing to set forward. However, there was no remedy; we were obliged to\\r\\ncomply, and accordingly joined in the cavalcade, which luckily took the\\r\\nsame road that we had proposed to follow. About the twilight we arrived\\r\\nat the place of our destination, but as the justice was gone to visit a\\r\\ngentleman in the country, with whom (we understood) he would probably\\r\\nstay all night, the robber was confined in an empty garret, three\\r\\nstories high, from which it seemed impossible for him to escape; this,\\r\\nnevertheless, was the case; for next morning when they went up stairs\\r\\nto bring him before the justice, the bird was flown, having got out at\\r\\nthe window upon the roof from whence he continued his route along the\\r\\ntops of the adjoining houses, and entered another garret where he\\r\\nskulked until the family were asleep; at which time he ventured down\\r\\nstairs, and let himself out by the street-door, which was open.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis event was a great disappointment to those that apprehended him,\\r\\nwho were flushed with the hopes of the reward; but gave me great joy,\\r\\nas I was permitted now to continue my journey, without any further\\r\\nmolestation. Resolving to make up for the small progress we had\\r\\nhitherto made, we this day travelled with great vigour and before night\\r\\nreached a market town twenty miles from the place from whence we set\\r\\nout in the morning, without meeting any adventure worth notice. Here\\r\\nhaving taken up our lodging at an an inn, I found myself so fatigued\\r\\nthat I began to despair of performing our journey on foot, and desired\\r\\nStrap to inquire if there were any waggon, return horses, or any cheap\\r\\ncarriage in this place, to depart for London next day. He was informed\\r\\nthat the waggon from Newcastle to London had halted there two nights\\r\\nago, and that it would be an easy matter to overtake it, if not the\\r\\nnext day, at farthest, the day after the next. This piece of news gave\\r\\nus some satisfaction; and, after having made a hearty supper on hashed\\r\\nmutton, we were shown to our room, which contained two beds, the one\\r\\nallotted for us, and the other for a very honest gentleman, who, we\\r\\nwere told, was then drinking below. Though we could have very well\\r\\ndispensed with his company, we were glad to submit to this disposition,\\r\\nas there was not another bed empty in the house; and accordingly went\\r\\nto rest, after having secured our baggage under the bolster. About two\\r\\nor three oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning I was awaked out of a very profound\\r\\nsleep by a dreadful noise in the chamber, which did not fail to throw\\r\\nme into an agony of consternation, when I heard these words pronounced\\r\\nwith a terrible voice: â\\x80\\x9cBlood and wounds! run the halbert into the guts\\r\\nof him thatâ\\x80\\x99s next you, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll blow the otherâ\\x80\\x99s brains out\\r\\npresently.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dreadful salutation had no sooner reached the ears of Strap than,\\r\\nstarting out of bed, he ran against somebody in the dark, and\\r\\noverturned him in an instant; at the same time bawling out, â\\x80\\x9cFire!\\r\\nmurder! fire!â\\x80\\x9d a cry which in a moment alarmed the whole house, and\\r\\nfilled our chamber with a crowd of naked people. When lights were\\r\\nbrought, the occasion of all this disturbance soon appeared; which was\\r\\nno other than a fellow lodger, whom we found lying on the floor,\\r\\nscratching his head, with a look testifying the utmost astonishment at\\r\\nthe concourse of apparitions that surrounded him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis honest gentleman was, it seems, a recruiting sergeant, who, having\\r\\nlisted two country fellows over night, dreaded they had mutinied, and\\r\\nthreatened to murder him and the drummer who was along with him. This\\r\\nmade such an impression on his imagination, that he got up in his sleep\\r\\nand expressed himself as above. When our apprehension of danger\\r\\nvanished, the company beheld one another with great surprise and mirth;\\r\\nbut what attracted the notice of everyone was our landlady, with\\r\\nnothing on her but her shift and a large pair of buckskin breeches,\\r\\nwith the backside before, which she had slipped on in the hurry, and\\r\\nher husband with her petticoat about his shoulders; one had wrapped\\r\\nhimself in a blanket, another was covered with a sheet, and the\\r\\ndrummer, who had given his only shirt to be washed, appeared in cuerpo\\r\\nwith a bolster rolled about his middle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this affair was discussed, everybody retired to his own apartment,\\r\\nthe sergeant slipped into bed, and my companion and I slept without any\\r\\nfurther disturbance till morning, when we got up, went to breakfast,\\r\\npaid our reckoning, and set forward in expectation of overtaking the\\r\\nwaggon; in which hope, however, we were disappointed for that day. As\\r\\nwe exerted ourselves more than usual, I found myself quite spent with\\r\\nfatigue, when we entered a small village in the twilight. We inquired\\r\\nfor a public-house, and were directed to one of a very sorry\\r\\nappearance. At our entrance the landlord, who seemed to be a venerable\\r\\nold man, with long gray hair, rose from a table placed by a large fire\\r\\nin a very neat paved kitchen, and with a cheerful countenance accosted\\r\\nus in these words: â\\x80\\x9cSalvete, pueri. Ingredimini.â\\x80\\x9d I was not a little\\r\\npleased to hear our host speak Latin, because I was in hope of\\r\\nrecommending myself to him by my knowledge in that language; I\\r\\ntherefore answered, without hesitation, â\\x80\\x9cDissolve frigus, ligna super\\r\\nfocoâ\\x80\\x94large reponens.â\\x80\\x9d I had no sooner pronounced these words, than the\\r\\nold gentleman, running towards me, shook me by the hand, crying, â\\x80\\x9cFili\\r\\nmi dilectissime! unde venis?â\\x80\\x94a superis, ni fallor?â\\x80\\x9d In short, finding\\r\\nwe were both read in the classics, he did not know how to testify his\\r\\nregard enough; but ordered his daughter, a jolly rosy-cheeked damsel\\r\\nwho was his sole domestic, to bring us a bottle of his quadrimum,\\r\\nrepeating from Horace at the same time, â\\x80\\x9cDeprome quadrimum sabina, O\\r\\nTholiarche, merum diota.â\\x80\\x9d This was excellent ale of his own brewing, of\\r\\nwhich he told us he had always an amphora four years old, for the use\\r\\nof himself and friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the course of our conversation, which was interlarded with scraps of\\r\\nLatin, we understood that this facetious person was a schoolmaster,\\r\\nwhose income being small, he was fain to keep a glass of good liquor\\r\\nfor the entertainment of passengers by which he made shift to make the\\r\\ntwo ends of the year meet. â\\x80\\x9cI am this day,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthe happiest old\\r\\nfellow in his majestyâ\\x80\\x99s dominions. My wife, rest her soul, is in\\r\\nheaven. My daughter is to be married next week; but the two chief\\r\\npleasures of my life are these (pointing to the bottle and a large\\r\\nedition of Horace that lay on the table). I am old, â\\x80\\x99tis trueâ\\x80\\x94what\\r\\nthen? the more reason I should enjoy the small share of life that\\r\\nremains, as my friend Flaccus advises: â\\x80\\x98Tu ne quaesieris (scire nefas)\\r\\nquem mihi, quem tibi finem dii dederint. Carpe diem, quam minimum\\r\\ncredula postero.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was very inquisitive about our affairs, we made no scruple of\\r\\nacquainting him with our situation, which when he had learned, he\\r\\nenriched us with advices how to behave in the world, telling us that he\\r\\nwas no stranger to the deceits of mankind. In the meantime he ordered\\r\\nhis daughter to lay a fowl to the fire for supper, for he was resolved\\r\\nthis night to regale his friendsâ\\x80\\x94permittens divis caetera. While our\\r\\nentertainment was preparing, our host recounted the adventures of his\\r\\nown life, which, as they contained nothing remarkable, I forbear to\\r\\nrehearse. When we had fared sumptuously, and drunk several bottles of\\r\\nhis I expressed a desire of going to rest, which was with some\\r\\ndifficulty complied with, after he had informed us that we should\\r\\novertake the waggon by noon next day; and that there was room enough in\\r\\nit for half-a-dozen, for there were only four passengers as yet in that\\r\\nconvenience.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore my comrade and I fell asleep, we had some conversation about the\\r\\ngood humour of our landlord, which gave Strap such an idea of his\\r\\nbenevolence, that he positively believed we should pay nothing for our\\r\\nlodging and entertainment. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t you observe,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat he has\\r\\nconceived a particular affection for usâ\\x80\\x94nay, even treated us at supper\\r\\nwith extraordinary fare, which, to be sure, we should not of ourselves\\r\\nhave called for?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was partly of Strapâ\\x80\\x99s opinion; but the experience I had of the world\\r\\nmade me suspend my belief till the morning, when, getting up betimes,\\r\\nwe breakfasted with our host and his daughter on hasty-pudding and ale,\\r\\nand desired to know what we had to pay. â\\x80\\x9cBiddy will let you know,\\r\\ngentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d said he; â\\x80\\x9cfor I never mind these matters. Money matters are\\r\\nbeneath the concern of one who lives upon the Horatian planâ\\x80\\x94Crescentum\\r\\nsequitur cura pecuniam.â\\x80\\x9d Meanwhile, Biddy, having consulted a slate\\r\\nthat hung in the corner, told us our reckoning came to 8s. 7d. â\\x80\\x9cEight\\r\\nshillings and seven pence!â\\x80\\x9d cried Strap, â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99tis impossible! you must be\\r\\nmistaken, young woman.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cReckon again, child,â\\x80\\x9d says her father, very\\r\\ndeliberately; â\\x80\\x9cperhaps you have miscounted.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo, indeed,â\\x80\\x9d replied she,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know my business better.â\\x80\\x9d I could contain my indignation no longer,\\r\\nbut said it was an unconscionable bill, and demanded to know the\\r\\nparticulars; upon which the old man got up, muttering, â\\x80\\x9cAy, ay, let us\\r\\nsee the particularsâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s but reasonable.â\\x80\\x9d And, taking pen, ink, and\\r\\npaper, wrote the following items:\\r\\n\\r\\nTo bread and beer\\t0 6 To a fowl and sausages\\t2 6 To four bottles\\r\\nof _quadrim_\\t2 0 To fire and tobacco\\t0 7 To lodging\\t2 0 To\\r\\nbreakfast\\t1 0 â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x94 8 7\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he had not the appearance of a common publican, and had raised a\\r\\nsort of veneration in me by his demeanour the preceding night, it was\\r\\nnot in my power to upbraid him as he deserved; therefore, I contented\\r\\nmyself with saying I was sure he did not learn to be an extortioner\\r\\nfrom Horace. He answered, I was but a young man and did not know the\\r\\nworld, or I would not tax him with extortion, whose only aim was to\\r\\nlive contentus parvo, and keep off importuna pauperies. My fellow\\r\\ntraveller could not so easily put up with this imposition; but swore he\\r\\nshould either take one-third of the money or go without. While we were\\r\\nengaged in this dispute, I perceived the daughter go out, and,\\r\\nconjecturing the occasion, immediately paid the exorbitant demand,\\r\\nwhich was no sooner done than Biddy returned with two stout fellows,\\r\\nwho came in on pretence of taking their morning draught, but in reality\\r\\nto frighten us into compliance. Just as we departed, Strap, who was\\r\\nhalf-distracted on account of this piece of expense, went up to the\\r\\nschoolmaster, and, grinning in his face, pronounced with great\\r\\nemphasisâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cSemper avarus eget.â\\x80\\x9d To which the pedant replied, with a\\r\\nmalicious smileâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cAnimum rege, qui, nisi paret, imperat.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe descry the Waggonâ\\x80\\x94get into itâ\\x80\\x94arrive at an innâ\\x80\\x94our Fellow Travellers\\r\\ndescribedâ\\x80\\x94a Mistake is committed by Strap, which produces strange\\r\\nthings\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe travelled half-a-mile without exchanging one word; my thoughts being\\r\\nengrossed by the knavery of the world, to which I must be daily\\r\\nexposed, and the contemplation of my finances, which began sensibly to\\r\\ndiminish. At length, Strap, who could hold no longer, addressed me\\r\\nthus: â\\x80\\x9cWell, fools and their money are soon parted. If my advice had\\r\\nbeen taken, that old skin-flint should have been dâ\\x80\\x94nâ\\x80\\x99d before he had\\r\\ngot more than the third of his demand. â\\x80\\x99Tis a sure sign you came easily\\r\\nby your money, when you squander it away in this manner. Ah! God help\\r\\nyou, how many bristly beards must I have mowed before I earned four\\r\\nshillings and threepence-halfpenny, which is all thrown to the dogs!\\r\\nHow many days have I sat weaving hair till my toes were numbed by the\\r\\ncold, my fingers cramped, and my nose as blue as the sign of the\\r\\nperiwig that hung over the door! What the devil was you afraid of? I\\r\\nwould have engaged to box with any one of those fellows who came in for\\r\\na guineaâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99m sureâ\\x80\\x94I have beat stouter men than either of them.â\\x80\\x9d And,\\r\\nindeed, my companion would have fought anybody when his life was in no\\r\\ndanger; but he had a mortal aversion to fire-arms and all instruments\\r\\nof death. In order to appease him, I assured him no part of this\\r\\nextraordinary expense should fall upon his shoulders; at which\\r\\ndeclaration he was affronted, and told me he would have me to know\\r\\nthat, although he was a poor barberâ\\x80\\x99s boy, yet he had a soul to spend\\r\\nbig money with the best squire of the land.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving walked all day at a great pace, without halting for a\\r\\nrefreshment, we descried, toward the evening, to our inexpressible joy,\\r\\nthe waggon about a quarter of a mile before us; and, by that time we\\r\\nreached it, were both of us so weary that I verily believe it would\\r\\nhave been impracticable for us to have walked one mile farther. We,\\r\\ntherefore, bargained with the driver, whose name was Joey, to give us a\\r\\ncast to the next stage for a shilling; at which place we should meet\\r\\nthe master of the waggon, with whom we might agree for the rest of the\\r\\njourney.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly the convenience stopped, and Joey having placed the ladder,\\r\\nStrap (being loaded with our baggage) mounted first; but, just as he\\r\\nwas getting in, a tremendous voice assailed his ears in these words:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGodâ\\x80\\x99s fury! there shall no passengers come here.â\\x80\\x9d The poor shaver was\\r\\nso disconcerted at this exclamation, which both he and I imagined\\r\\nproceeded from the mouth of a giant, that he descended with great\\r\\nvelocity and a countenance as white as paper. Joey, perceiving our\\r\\nastonishment, called, with an arch sneer, â\\x80\\x9cWaunds, coptain, whay woant\\r\\nyau sooffer the poor waggoneer to meake a penny? Coom, coom, young man,\\r\\nget oop, get oop, never moind the coptain; Iâ\\x80\\x99se not afeard of the\\r\\ncoptain.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was not encouragement sufficient to Strap, who could not be\\r\\nprevailed upon to venture up again; upon which I attempted, though not\\r\\nwithout a quaking heart, when I heard the same voice muttering, like\\r\\ndistant thunderâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cHell and the devil confound me, if I donâ\\x80\\x99t make you\\r\\nsmart for this!â\\x80\\x9d However, I crept in, and by accident got an empty\\r\\nplace in the straw, which I immediately took possession of, without\\r\\nbeing able to discern the faces of my fellow-travellers in the dark.\\r\\nStrap following, with the knapsack on his back, chanced to take the\\r\\nother side, and, by a jolt of the carriage, pitched directly upon the\\r\\nstomach of the captain, who bellowed out, in a most dreadful manner,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBlood and thunder! whereâ\\x80\\x99s my sword?â\\x80\\x9d At these words my frighted\\r\\ncomrade started up, and, at one spring, bounced against me with such\\r\\nforce that I thought he was the supposed son of Anak, who intended to\\r\\npress me to death. In the meantime a female voice cried, â\\x80\\x9cBless me!\\r\\nwhat is the matter, my dear?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe matter,â\\x80\\x9d replied the captain, â\\x80\\x9cdâ\\x80\\x94n\\r\\nmy blood! my guts are squeezed into a pancake by that Scotchmanâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhump.â\\x80\\x9d Strap, trembling all the while at my back, asked him pardon, and\\r\\nlaid the blame of what had happened upon the jolting of the waggon; and\\r\\nthe woman who spoke before went on: â\\x80\\x9cAy, ay, my dear, it is our own\\r\\nfault; we may thank ourselves for all the inconveniences we meet with.\\r\\nI thank God I never travelled so before. I am sure if my lady or Sir\\r\\nJohn were to know where we are they would not sleep this night for\\r\\nvexation. I wish to God we had writ for the chariot; I know we shall\\r\\nnever be forgiven.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCome, come, my dear,â\\x80\\x9d replied the captain, â\\x80\\x9cit\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t signify fretting now; we shall laugh it over as a frolic; I hope\\r\\nyou will not suffer in your health. I shall make my lord very merry\\r\\nwith our adventures in this diligence.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discourse gave me such a high notion of the captain and his lady\\r\\nthat I durst not venture to join in the conversation; but immediately\\r\\nafter another female voice began: â\\x80\\x9cSome people give themselves a great\\r\\nmany needless airs; better folks than any here have travelled in\\r\\nwaggons before now. Some of us have rode in coaches and chariots, with\\r\\nthree footmen behind them, without making so much fuss about it. What\\r\\nthen? We are now all upon a footing; therefore let us be sociable and\\r\\nmerry. What do you say, Isaac? Is not this a good motion, you doting\\r\\nrogue? Speak, you old cent per cent fornicator? What desperate debt are\\r\\nyou thinking of? What mortgage are you planning? Well, Isaac,\\r\\npositively you shall never gain my favour till you turn over a new\\r\\nleaf, grow honest, and live like a gentleman. In the meantime give me a\\r\\nkiss, you old fumbler.â\\x80\\x9d These words, accompanied with a hearty smack,\\r\\nenlivened the person to whom they were addressed to such a degree that\\r\\nhe cried, in transport, though with a faltering voice, â\\x80\\x9cAh! you wanton\\r\\nbaggageâ\\x80\\x94upon my credit, you are a waggish girlâ\\x80\\x94he, he, he!â\\x80\\x9d This laugh\\r\\nintroduced a fit of coughing, which almost suffocated the poor usurer\\r\\n(such we afterwards found was the profession of this our\\r\\nfellow-traveller).\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout this time I fell asleep, and enjoyed a comfortable nap till such\\r\\ntime as we arrived at the inn where we put up. Here, having alighted\\r\\nfrom the waggon, I had an opportunity of viewing the passengers in\\r\\norder as they entered. The first who appeared was a brisk, airy girl,\\r\\nabout twenty years old, with a silver-laced hat on her head instead of\\r\\na cap, a blue stuff riding-suit, trimmed with silver very much\\r\\ntarnished, and a whip in her hand. After her came, limping, an old man,\\r\\nwith a worsted nightcap buttoned under his chin, and a broad-brimmed\\r\\nhat slouched over it, an old rusty blue cloak tied about his neck,\\r\\nunder which appeared a brown surtout, that covered a threadbare coat\\r\\nand waistcoat, and, as he afterwards discerned, a dirty flannel jacket.\\r\\nHis eyes were hollow, bleared, and gummy; his face was shrivelled into\\r\\na thousand wrinkles, his gums were destitute of teeth, his nose sharp\\r\\nand drooping, his chin peaked and prominent, so that, when he mumped or\\r\\nspoke, they approached one another like a pair of nutcrackers: he\\r\\nsupported himself on an ivory-headed cane and his whole figure was a\\r\\njust emblem of winter, famine, and avarice. But how was I surprised,\\r\\nwhen I beheld the formidable captain in the shape of a little thin\\r\\ncreature, about the age of forty, with a long withered visage, very\\r\\nmuch resembling that of a baboon, through the upper part of which two\\r\\nlittle gray eyes peeped: he wore his own hair in a queue that reached\\r\\nto his rump, which immoderate length, I suppose, was the occasion of a\\r\\nbaldness that appeared on the crown of his head when he deigned to take\\r\\noff his hat, which was very much of the size and cock of Pistolâ\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving laid aside his great-coat, I could not help admiring the\\r\\nextraordinary make of this man of war: he was about five feet and three\\r\\ninches high, sixteen inches of which went to his face and long scraggy\\r\\nneck: his thighs were about six inches in length, his legs resembling\\r\\nspindles or drumsticks, five feet and a half, and his body, which put\\r\\nme in mind of extension without substance, engrossed the remainder: so\\r\\nthat on the whole, he appeared like a spider or grasshopper erect, and\\r\\nwas almost a vox et praeterea nihil. His dress consisted of a frock of\\r\\nwhat is called bearskin, the skirts of which were about half a foot\\r\\nlong, an hussar waistcoat, scarlet breeches reaching half way down his\\r\\nthighs, worsted stockings rolled up almost to his groin, and shoes with\\r\\nwooden heels at least two inches high; he carried a sword very near as\\r\\nlong as himself in one hand, and with the other conducted his lady, who\\r\\nseemed to be a woman of his own age, and still retained some remains of\\r\\nan agreeable person, but so ridiculously affected, that, had I not been\\r\\na novice in the world, I might have easily perceived in her the\\r\\ndeplorable vanity and second-hand airs of a ladyâ\\x80\\x99s woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were all assembled in the kitchen, when Captain Weazel (for that was\\r\\nhis name) desired a room with a fire for himself and spouse, and told\\r\\nthe landlord they would up by themselves. The innkeeper replied that he\\r\\ncould not afford them a room by themselves; and as for supping, he had\\r\\nprepared victuals for the passengers in the waggon, without respect of\\r\\npersons, but if he could prevail on the rest to let him have his choice\\r\\nin a separate manner, he should be very well pleased. This was no\\r\\nsooner said than all of us declared against the proposal, and Miss\\r\\nJenny (our other female passenger), observed that, if Captain Weazel\\r\\nand his lady had a mind to sup by themselves, they might wait until we\\r\\nshould have done. At this hint the captain put on a martial frown, and\\r\\nlooked very big, without speaking; while his yokefellow, with a\\r\\ndisdainful toss of her nose, muttered something about â\\x80\\x9cCreature!â\\x80\\x9d which\\r\\nMiss Jenny overhearing, stepped up to her, saying, â\\x80\\x9cNone of your names,\\r\\ngood Mrs. Abigail. Creature, quothaâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ll assure you no such creature as\\r\\nyou neitherâ\\x80\\x94no ten-pound sneakerâ\\x80\\x94no quality-coupler.â\\x80\\x9d Here the captain\\r\\ninterposed, with a â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94e, madam, what do you mean by that?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n you\\r\\nsir, who are you?â\\x80\\x9d replied Miss Jenny, â\\x80\\x9cwho made you a captain, you\\r\\npitiful, trencher-scraping, pimping curler? â\\x80\\x99Sdeath! the army is come\\r\\nto a fine pass, when such fellows as you get commissions. What, I\\r\\nsuppose you think I donâ\\x80\\x99t know you? Egad, you and your helpmate are\\r\\nwell metâ\\x80\\x94a cast-off mistress and a bald valet-de-chambre are well yoked\\r\\ntogether.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBlood and wounds!â\\x80\\x9d cried Weazel, â\\x80\\x9cdâ\\x80\\x99ye question the honour\\r\\nof my wife, madam? Hell and d-ion! No man in England durst say so\\r\\nmuchâ\\x80\\x94I would flay him, carbonado him! Fury and destruction! I would\\r\\nhave his liver for my supper.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he drew his sword and\\r\\nflourished with it, to the great terror of Strap; while Miss Jenny,\\r\\nsnapping her fingers, told him she did not value his resentment a\\r\\nlouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of this quarrel the master of the waggon alighted, who,\\r\\nunderstanding the cause of the disturbance, and fearing the captain and\\r\\nhis lady would take umbrage and leave his carriage, was at great pains\\r\\nto have everything made up, which he at last accomplished, and we sat\\r\\ndown to supper altogether. At bedtime we were shown to our apartments;\\r\\nthe old usurer, Strap, and I, to one room; the captain, his wife, and\\r\\nMiss Jenny, to another. About midnight, my companionâ\\x80\\x99s bowels being\\r\\ndisordered, he got up, in order to go backward, but in his return,\\r\\nmistaking one door for another, entered Weazelâ\\x80\\x99s chamber, and without\\r\\nany hesitation went to bed to his wife, who was fast asleep, the\\r\\ncaptain being at another end of the room groping for some empty vessel,\\r\\nin lieu of his own chamberpot, which was leaky: as he did not perceive\\r\\nStrap coming in, he went towards his own bed, after having found a\\r\\nconvenience; but no sooner did he feel a rough head, covered with a\\r\\ncotton nightcap, than it came into his mind that he had mistaken Miss\\r\\nJennyâ\\x80\\x99s bed instead of his own, and that the head he felt was that of\\r\\nsome gallant, with whom she had made an assignation. Full of his\\r\\nconjecture, and scandalised at the prostitution of his apartment, he\\r\\nsnatched up the vessel he had just before filled, and emptied it at\\r\\nonce on the astonished barber and his own wife, who waking at that\\r\\ninstant, broke forth into lamentable cries, which not only alarmed the\\r\\nhusband beyond measure, but frighted poor Strap almost out of his\\r\\nsenses; for he verily believed himself bewitched, especially when the\\r\\nincensed captain seized him by the throat, with a volley of oaths,\\r\\nasking him how he durst have the presumption to attempt the chastity of\\r\\nhis wife. Poor Strap was so amazed and confounded, that he could say\\r\\nnothing butâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cI take God to witness sheâ\\x80\\x99s a virgin for me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Weazel, enraged to find herself in such a pickle through the\\r\\nprecipitation of her husband, arose in her shift, and with the heel of\\r\\nher shoe which she found by the bedside, belaboured the captainâ\\x80\\x99s bald\\r\\npate till he roared â\\x80\\x9cMurder.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll teach you to empty your stinkpots\\r\\non me,â\\x80\\x9d cried she, â\\x80\\x9cyou pitiful hop-oâ\\x80\\x99-my-thumb coxcomb. What, I\\r\\nwarrant youâ\\x80\\x99re jealous, you man of lath. Was it for this I condescended\\r\\nto take you to my bed, you poor, withered, sapless twig?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe noise occasioned by this adventure had brought the master of the\\r\\nwaggon and me to the door, where we overheard all that passed with\\r\\ngreat satisfaction. In the meantime we were alarmed with the cry of\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cRape! Murder! Rape!â\\x80\\x9d which Jenny pronounced with great vociferation.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! You vile abominable old villain,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cwould you rob me of\\r\\nmy virtue? But Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be revenged of you, you old goat! I will! Help! for\\r\\nheavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake! help! I shall be ravished! ruined! help!â\\x80\\x9d Some servants\\r\\nof the inn, hearing this cry, came running upstairs with lights, and\\r\\nsuch weapons as chance afforded; when we beheld a very diverting scene.\\r\\nIn one corner stood the poor captain shivering in his shirt, which was\\r\\nall torn to rags: with a woeful visage, scratched all over by his wife,\\r\\nwho had by this time wrapped the counterpane about her, and sat sobbing\\r\\non the side of her bed. At the other end lay the old usurer, sprawling\\r\\non Miss Jennyâ\\x80\\x99s bed, with his flannel jacket over his shirt, and his\\r\\ntawny meagre limbs exposed to the air; while she held him fast by the\\r\\ntwo ears, and loaded him with execrations. When he asked what was the\\r\\nmatter, she affected to weep, told us she was afraid that wicked rogue\\r\\nhad ruined her in her sleep, and bade us take notice of what we saw,\\r\\nfor she intended to make use of our evidence against him. The poor\\r\\nwretch looked like one more dead than alive, and begged to be released;\\r\\na favour which he had no sooner obtained than he protested she was no\\r\\nwoman, but a devil incarnateâ\\x80\\x94that she had first seduced his flesh to\\r\\nrebel, and then betrayed him. â\\x80\\x9cYes, cockatrice,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, â\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\nknow you laid this snare for meâ\\x80\\x94but you shanâ\\x80\\x99t succeedâ\\x80\\x94for I will hang\\r\\nmyself before you shall get a farthing of me.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he crawled to\\r\\nhis own bed, groaning all the way. We then advanced to the Captain, who\\r\\ntold us, â\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, here has been a dâ\\x80\\x94d mistake; but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be revenged\\r\\non him who was the cause of it. That Scotchman who carries the knapsack\\r\\nshall not breathe this vital air another day, if my name be Weazel. My\\r\\ndear, I ask you ten thousand pardons; you are sensible, I could mean no\\r\\nharm to you.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI know not what you meant,â\\x80\\x9d replied she, sighing, â\\x80\\x9cbut I\\r\\nknow I have got enough to send me to my grave.â\\x80\\x9d At length they were\\r\\nreconciled. The wife was complimented with a share of Miss Jennyâ\\x80\\x99s bed\\r\\n(her own being overflowed), and the master of the waggon invited Weazel\\r\\nto sleep the remaining part of the night with him. I retired to mine,\\r\\nwhere I found Strap mortally afraid, he having stolen away in the dark\\r\\nwhile the captain and his lady were at loggerheads.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Weazel challenges Strap, who declines the Combatâ\\x80\\x94an Affair\\r\\nbetween the Captain and meâ\\x80\\x94the Usurer is fain to give Miss Jenny five\\r\\nGuineas for a Releaseâ\\x80\\x94we are in Danger of losing a Mealâ\\x80\\x94the Behaviour\\r\\nof Weazel, Jenny, and Joey, on that Occasionâ\\x80\\x94an Account of Captain\\r\\nWeazel and his Ladyâ\\x80\\x94the Captainâ\\x80\\x99s Courage triedâ\\x80\\x94Isaacâ\\x80\\x99s mirth at the\\r\\nCaptainâ\\x80\\x99s Expense\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning I agreed to give the master of the waggon ten shillings\\r\\nfor my passage to London, provided Strap should be allowed to take my\\r\\nplace when I should be disposed to walk. At the same time I desired him\\r\\nto appease the incensed captain, who had entered the kitchen with a\\r\\ndrawn sword in his hand, and threatened with many oaths to sacrifice\\r\\nthe villain who attempted to violate his bed; but it was to no purpose\\r\\nfor the master to explain the mistake, and assure him of the poor ladâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ninnocence, who stood trembling behind me all the while: the more\\r\\nsubmission that appeared in Strap, the more implacable seemed the\\r\\nresentment of Weazel, who swore he must either fight him or he would\\r\\ninstantly put him to death. I was extremely provoked at this insolence,\\r\\nand told him, it could not be supposed that a poor barber lad would\\r\\nengage a man of the sword at his own weapon; but I was persuaded he\\r\\nwould wrestle or box with him. To which proposal Strap immediately gave\\r\\nassent, by saying, â\\x80\\x9che would box with him for a guinea.â\\x80\\x9d Weazel replied\\r\\nwith a look of disdain, that it was beneath any gentleman of his\\r\\ncharacter to fight like a porter, or even to put himself on a footing,\\r\\nin any respect, with such a fellow as Strap. â\\x80\\x9cOdds bodikins!â\\x80\\x9d cries\\r\\nJoey, â\\x80\\x9csure, coptain, yaw would not commit moorder! Hereâ\\x80\\x99s a poor lad\\r\\nthat is willing to make atonement for his offence; and an that woanâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nsatisfie yaw, offers to fight yaw fairly. And yaw woanâ\\x80\\x99t box, I dare\\r\\nsay, he will coodgel with yaw. Woanâ\\x80\\x99t yaw, my lad?â\\x80\\x9d Strap, after some\\r\\nhesitation, answered, â\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll cudgel with him.â\\x80\\x9d But this\\r\\nexpedient being also rejected by the captain, I began to smell his\\r\\ncharacter, and, tipping Strap the wink, told the captain that I had\\r\\nalways heard it said, the person who receives a challenge should have\\r\\nthe choice of the weapons; this therefore being the rule in point of\\r\\nhonour, I would venture to promise on the head of my companion, that he\\r\\nwould even fight Captain Weazel at sharps; but it should be with such\\r\\nsharps as Strap was best acquainted with, namely, razors. At my\\r\\nmentioning razors: I could perceive the captainâ\\x80\\x99s colour change while\\r\\nStrap, pulling me by the sleeve, whispered with great eagerness: â\\x80\\x9cNo,\\r\\nno, no; for the love of God, donâ\\x80\\x99t make any such bargain.â\\x80\\x9d At length,\\r\\nWeazel, recovering himself, turned towards me, and with a ferocious\\r\\ncountenance asked, â\\x80\\x9cWho the devil are you? Will you fight me?â\\x80\\x9d With\\r\\nthese words, putting himself in a posture, I was grievously alarmed at\\r\\nseeing the point of a sword within half a foot of my breast; and,\\r\\nspringing to one side, snatched up a spit that stood in the\\r\\nchimney-corner, with which I kept my formidable adversary at bay, who\\r\\nmade a great many half-longes, skipping backward at every push, till at\\r\\nlast I pinned him up in a corner, to the no small diversion of the\\r\\ncompany. While he was in this situation his wife entered, and, seeing\\r\\nher husband in these dangerous circumstances, uttered a dreadful\\r\\nscream: in this emergency, Weazel demanded a cessation, which was\\r\\nimmediately granted; and at last was contented with the submission of\\r\\nStrap, who, falling on his knees before him, protested the innocence of\\r\\nhis intention, and asked pardon for the mistake he had committed. This\\r\\naffair being ended without bloodshed, we went to breakfast, but missed\\r\\ntwo of our company, namely, Miss Jenny and the usurer. As for the\\r\\nfirst, Mrs. Weazel informed us, that she had kept her awake all night\\r\\nwith her groans; and that when she rose in the morning, Miss Jenny was\\r\\nso much indisposed that she could not proceed on her journey. At that\\r\\ninstant, a message came from her to the master of the waggon, who\\r\\nimmediately went into her chamber, followed by us all. She told him in\\r\\na lamentable tone, that she was afraid of a miscarriage, owing to the\\r\\nfright she received last night from the brutality of Isaac; and, as the\\r\\nevent was uncertain, desired the usurer might be detained to answer for\\r\\nthe consequence. Accordingly, this ancient Tarquin was found in the\\r\\nwaggon, whither he had retired to avoid the shame of last nightâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndisgrace, and brought by force into her presence. He no sooner appeared\\r\\nthan she began to weep and sigh most piteously, and told us, if she\\r\\ndied, she would leave her blood upon the head of that ravisher. Poor\\r\\nIsaac turned up his eyes and hands to heaven, prayed that God would\\r\\ndeliver him from the machinations of that Jezebel; and assured us, with\\r\\ntears in his eyes, that his being found in bed with her was the result\\r\\nof her own invitation. The waggoner, understanding the case, advised\\r\\nIsaac to make it up, by giving her a sum of money: to which advice he\\r\\nreplied with great vehemence, â\\x80\\x9cA sum of money!â\\x80\\x94a halter for the\\r\\ncockatrice!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh! â\\x80\\x99tis very well,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Jenny; â\\x80\\x9cI see it is in\\r\\nvain to attempt that flinty heart of his by fair means. Joey, be so\\r\\ngood as to go to the justice, and tell him there is a sick person here,\\r\\nwho wants to see him on an affair of consequence.â\\x80\\x9d At the name of\\r\\njustice Isaac trembled, and bidding Joey stay, asked with a quavering\\r\\nvoice, â\\x80\\x9cWhat she would have? She told him that, as he had not\\r\\nperpetrated his wicked purpose, she would be satisfied with a small\\r\\nmatter. And though the damage she might sustain in her health might be\\r\\nirreparable, she would give him a release for a hundred guineas.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cA\\r\\nhundred guineas!â\\x80\\x9d cried he in an ecstacy, â\\x80\\x9ca hundred furies! Where\\r\\nshould a poor old wretch like me have a hundred guineas? If I had so\\r\\nmuch money, dâ\\x80\\x99ya think I should be found travelling in a waggon, at\\r\\nthis season of the year?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCome, come,â\\x80\\x9d replied Jenny, â\\x80\\x9cnone of your\\r\\nmiserly artifice here. You think I donâ\\x80\\x99t know Isaac Rapine, the\\r\\nmoney-broker, in the Minories. Ah! you old rogue! many a pawn have you\\r\\nhad of me and my acquaintance, which was never redeemed.â\\x80\\x9d Isaac,\\r\\nfinding it was in vain to disguise himself, offered twenty shillings\\r\\nfor a discharge, which she absolutely refused under fifty pounds: at\\r\\nlast, however, she was brought down to five, which he paid with great\\r\\nreluctancy, rather than be prosecuted for a rape. After which\\r\\naccommodation, the sick person made a shift to get into the waggon, and\\r\\nwe set forward in great tranquillity; Strap being accommodated with\\r\\nJoeyâ\\x80\\x99s horse, the driver himself choosing to walk. The morning and\\r\\nforenoon we were entertained with an account of the valour of Captain\\r\\nWeazel, who told us he had once knocked down a soldier that made game\\r\\nof him; tweaked a drawer by the nose, who found fault with his picking\\r\\nhis teeth with a fork, at another time; and that he had moreover\\r\\nchallenged a cheesemonger, who had the presumption to be his rival: for\\r\\nthe truth of which exploits he appealed to his wife. She confirmed\\r\\nwhatever he said, and observed, â\\x80\\x9cThe last affair happened that very day\\r\\non which I received a love-letter from Squire Gobble, and donâ\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\nremember, my dear, I was prodigiously sick that very night with eating\\r\\nortolans, when my Lord Diddle took notice of my complexionâ\\x80\\x99s being\\r\\naltered, and my lady was so alarmed that she had well nigh fainted?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, my dear,â\\x80\\x9d replied the captain, â\\x80\\x9cyou know my lord said to me, with\\r\\na sneer, â\\x80\\x98Billy, Mrs. Weazel is certainly breeding.â\\x80\\x99 And I answered\\r\\ncavalierly, â\\x80\\x98My lord, I wish I could return the compliment.â\\x80\\x99 Upon which\\r\\nthe whole company broke out into an immoderate fit of laughter; and my\\r\\nlord, who loves a repartee dearly, came round and bussed me.â\\x80\\x9d We\\r\\ntravelled in this manner five days, without interruption or meeting\\r\\nanything worth notice: Miss Jenny, who soon recovered her spirits,\\r\\nentertaining us every day with diverting songs, of which she could sing\\r\\na great number; and rallying her own gallant, who, notwithstanding,\\r\\nwould never be reconciled to her. On the sixth day, while we were about\\r\\nto sit down to dinner, the innkeeper came and told us, that three\\r\\ngentlemen, just arrived, had ordered the victuals to be carried to\\r\\ntheir apartment, although he had informed them that they were bespoke\\r\\nby the passengers in the waggon. To which information they had replied,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe passengers in the waggon might be dâ\\x80\\x94d, their betters must be\\r\\nserved before them; they supposed it would be no hardship on such\\r\\ntravellers to dine upon bread and cheese for one day.â\\x80\\x9d This was a\\r\\nterrible disappointment to us all; and we laid our heads together how\\r\\nto remedy it; when Miss Jenny observed that Captain Weazel, being by\\r\\nprofession a soldier, ought in this case to protect and prevent us from\\r\\nbeing insulted. But the Captain excused himself, saying, he would not\\r\\nfor all the world be known to have travelled in a waggon! swearing at\\r\\nthe same time, that could he appear with honour, they should eat his\\r\\nsword sooner than his provision. Upon this declaration, Miss Jenny,\\r\\nsnatching his weapon, drew it, and ran immediately into the kitchen,\\r\\nwhere she threatened to put the cook to death if he did not send the\\r\\nvictuals into our chamber immediately. The noise she made brought the\\r\\nthree strangers down, one of whom no sooner perceived her than he\\r\\ncried, â\\x80\\x9cHa! Jenny Ramper! what the devil brought thee hither?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMy dear\\r\\nJack Rattle!â\\x80\\x9d replied she, running into his arms, â\\x80\\x9cis it you? Then\\r\\nWeazel may go to hell for a dinnerâ\\x80\\x94I shall dine with you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey consented to this proposal with a great deal of joy; and we were\\r\\non the point of being reduced to a very uncomfortable meal, when Joey,\\r\\nunderstanding the whole affair, entered the kitchen with a pitchfork in\\r\\nhis hand, and swore he would be the death of any man who should pretend\\r\\nto seize the victuals prepared for the waggon. The menace had like to\\r\\nhave produced fatal consequences; the three strangers drawing their\\r\\nswords, and being joined by their servants, and we ranging ourselves on\\r\\nthe side of Joey; when the landlord, interposing, offered to part with\\r\\nhis own dinner to keep the peace, which was accepted by the strangers;\\r\\nand we sat down at table without any further molestation. In the\\r\\nafternoon, I chose to walk along with Joey, and Strap took my place.\\r\\nHaving entered into a conversation with this driver, I soon found him\\r\\nto be a merry, facetious, good-natured fellow, and withal very arch; he\\r\\ninformed me, that Miss Jenny was a common girl upon the town, who,\\r\\nfalling into company with a recruiting officer, he carried her down in\\r\\nthe stage coach from London to Newcastle, where he had been arrested\\r\\nfor debt, and was now in prison; upon which she was fain to return to\\r\\nher former way of life, by this conveyance. He told me likewise, that\\r\\none of the gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s servants, who were left at the inn, having\\r\\naccidentally seen Weazel, immediately knew him, and acquainted Joey\\r\\nwith some particulars of his character. That he had served my Lord\\r\\nFrizzle in quality of valet-de-chambre many years, while he lived\\r\\nseparate from his lady; but, upon their reconciliation, she expressly\\r\\ninsisted upon Weazelâ\\x80\\x99s being turned off, as well as the woman he kept:\\r\\nwhen his lordship, to get rid of them both with a good grace, proposed\\r\\nthat he should marry his Mistress, and he would procure a commission\\r\\nfor him in the army: this expedient was agreed to, and Weazel is now,\\r\\nby his lordshipâ\\x80\\x99s interest, ensigned in â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99s regiment. I found he and I\\r\\nhad the same sentiments with regard to Weazelâ\\x80\\x99s courage, which he\\r\\nresolved to put to the trial, by alarming the passengers with the cry\\r\\nof a â\\x80\\x98highwayman!â\\x80\\x99 as soon as a horseman should appear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis scheme we put in practice, towards the dusk, when we descried a\\r\\nman on horseback approaching us. Joey had no sooner intimated to the\\r\\npeople in the waggon, that he was afraid we should be all robbed than a\\r\\ngeneral consternation arose: Strap jumped out of the waggon, and hid\\r\\nhimself behind a hedge. The usurer put forth ejaculations, and made a\\r\\nrustling among the straw, which made us conjecture he had hid something\\r\\nunder it. Mrs. Weazel, wringing her hands uttered lamentable cries: and\\r\\nthe captain, to our great amazement, began to snore; but this artifice\\r\\ndid not succeed; for Miss Jenny, shaking him by the shoulder, bawled\\r\\nout, â\\x80\\x9cSdeath! captain, is this a time to snore, when we are going to be\\r\\nrobbed? Get up for shame, and behave like a soldier and man of honour!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nWeazel pretended to be in a great passion for being disturbed, and\\r\\nswore he would have his nap out if all the highwaymen in England\\r\\nsurrounded him. â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n my blood! what are you afraid of?â\\x80\\x9d continued he;\\r\\nat the same time trembling with such agitation that the whole carriage\\r\\nshook. This singular piece of behaviour incensed Miss Ramper so much\\r\\nthat she cried, â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n your pitiful soul, you are as arrant a poltroon,\\r\\nas ever was drummed out of a regiment. Stop the waggon, Joeyâ\\x80\\x94let me\\r\\nout, and by Gâ\\x80\\x94d, if I have rhetoric enough, the thief shall not only\\r\\ntake your purse, but your skin also.â\\x80\\x9d So saying she leaped out with\\r\\ngreat agility. By this time the horseman came up and happened to be a\\r\\ngentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s servant well known to Joey, who communicated the scheme,\\r\\nand desired him to carry it on a little further, by going into the\\r\\nwaggon, and questioning those within. The stranger, consenting for the\\r\\nsake of diversion, approached it, and in a terrible tone demanded, â\\x80\\x9cWho\\r\\nhave we got here?â\\x80\\x9d Isaac replied, with a lamentable voice, â\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\npoor miserable sinner, who has got a small family to maintain, and\\r\\nnothing in the world wherewithal, but these fifteen shillings which if\\r\\nyou rob me of we must all starve together.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhoâ\\x80\\x99s that sobbing in the\\r\\nother corner?â\\x80\\x9d said the supposed highwayman. â\\x80\\x9cA poor unfortunate\\r\\nwoman,â\\x80\\x9d answered Mrs. Weazle, â\\x80\\x9cupon whom I beg you, for Christâ\\x80\\x99s sake,\\r\\nto have compassion.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAre you maid or wife,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cWife, to my\\r\\nsorrow,â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cWho, or where is your husband?â\\x80\\x9d continued he. â\\x80\\x9cMy\\r\\nhusband,â\\x80\\x9d replied Mrs. Weazel, â\\x80\\x9cis an officer in the army and was left\\r\\nsick at the last inn where we dined.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou must be mistaken, madam,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid he, â\\x80\\x9cfor I myself saw him get into the waggon this afternoon. But\\r\\npray what smell is that? Sure your lapdog has befouled himself; let me\\r\\ncatch hold of the nasty cur, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll teach him better manners.â\\x80\\x9d Here he\\r\\nlaid hold of one of Weazelâ\\x80\\x99s legs, and pulled him out from under his\\r\\nwifeâ\\x80\\x99s petticoat, where he had concealed himself. The poor trembling\\r\\ncaptain, being detected in his inglorious situation, rubbed his eyes,\\r\\nand affecting to wake out of sleep, cried, â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter? Whatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nthe matter?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe matter is not much,â\\x80\\x9d answered the horseman; â\\x80\\x9cI only\\r\\ncalled in to inquire after your health, and so adieu, most noble\\r\\ncaptain.â\\x80\\x9d He clapped spurs to his horse, and was out of sight in a\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was some time before Weazel could recollect himself, but at length\\r\\nreassuming the big look, he said, â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n the fellow! why did he ride away\\r\\nbefore I had time to ask him how his lord and lady do? Donâ\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\nremember Tom, my dear?â\\x80\\x9d addressing himself to his wife. â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d replied\\r\\nshe, â\\x80\\x9cI think I do remember something of the fellow, but you know I\\r\\nseldom converse with people of his station.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHey-day!â\\x80\\x9d cried Joey, â\\x80\\x9cdo\\r\\nyaw knaw the young mon, coptain?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cKnow him,â\\x80\\x9d said Weazel, â\\x80\\x9cmany a time\\r\\nhas he filled a glass of Burgundy for me, at my Lord Trippettâ\\x80\\x99s table.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what may his name be, coptain?â\\x80\\x9d said Joey. â\\x80\\x9cHis name!â\\x80\\x94his name,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nreplied Weazel, â\\x80\\x9cis Tom Rinser.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWaunds,â\\x80\\x9d cried Joey, â\\x80\\x9ca has changed\\r\\nhis own neame then! for Iâ\\x80\\x99se lay a wager he was christened John\\r\\nTrotter.â\\x80\\x9d This observation raised a laugh against the captain, who\\r\\nseemed very much disconcerted; when Isaac broke silence, and said, â\\x80\\x9cIt\\r\\nis no matter who or what he was, since he has not proved the robber we\\r\\nsuspected, and we ought to bless God for our narrow escape.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBless\\r\\nGod,â\\x80\\x9d said Weazel, â\\x80\\x9cbless the devil! for what? Had he been a\\r\\nhighwayman, I should have eaten his blood, body, and guts, before he\\r\\nhad robbed me, or any one in this diligence.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHa, ha, ha,â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss\\r\\nJenny, â\\x80\\x9cI believe you will eat all you kill, indeed, captain.â\\x80\\x9d The\\r\\nusurer was so well pleased at the event of this adventure, that he\\r\\ncould not refrain from being severe, and took notice that Captain\\r\\nWeazel seemed to be a good Christian, for he had armed himself with\\r\\npatience and resignation, instead of carnal weapons; and worked out his\\r\\nsalvation with fear and trembling. This piece of satire occasioned a\\r\\ngreat deal of mirth at Weazelâ\\x80\\x99s expense, who muttered a great many\\r\\noaths, and threatened to cut Isaacâ\\x80\\x99s throat. The usurer, taking hold of\\r\\nthis menace, said, â\\x80\\x9cGentlemen and ladies, I take you all to witness,\\r\\nthat my life is in danger from this bloody-minded officer; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have\\r\\nhim bound over to the peace.â\\x80\\x9d This second sneer produced another laugh\\r\\nagainst him, and he remained crestfallen during the remaining part of\\r\\nour journey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStrap and I are terrified by an Apparitionâ\\x80\\x94Strapâ\\x80\\x99s Conjectureâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nMystery explained by Joeyâ\\x80\\x94we arrive in Londonâ\\x80\\x94our Dress and Appearance\\r\\ndescribedâ\\x80\\x94we are insulted in the Streetâ\\x80\\x94an Adventure in an Alehouseâ\\x80\\x94we\\r\\nare imposed upon by a waggish Footmanâ\\x80\\x94set to rights by a\\r\\nTobacconistâ\\x80\\x94take Lodgingsâ\\x80\\x94dive for a Dinnerâ\\x80\\x94an Accident at our Ordinary\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe arrived at our inn, supped, and went to bed; but Strapâ\\x80\\x99s distemper\\r\\ncontinuing, he was obliged to rise in the middle of the night, and\\r\\ntaking the candle in his hand, which he had left burning for the\\r\\npurpose, he went down to the house of office, whence in a short time he\\r\\nreturned in a great hurry, with his hair standing on end, and a look\\r\\nbetokening horror and astonishment. Without speaking a word, he set\\r\\ndown the light and jumped into bed behind me, where he lay and trembled\\r\\nwith great violence. When I asked him what was the matter, he replied,\\r\\nwith a broken accent, â\\x80\\x9cGod have mercy on us! I have seen the devil!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThough my prejudice was not quite so strong as his, I was not a little\\r\\nalarmed at this exclamation, and much more so when I heard the sound of\\r\\nbells approaching our chamber, and felt my bedfellow cling close to me,\\r\\nuttering these words, â\\x80\\x9cChrist have mercy upon us; there he comes!â\\x80\\x9d At\\r\\nthat instance a monstrous overgrown raven entered our chamber, with\\r\\nbells at his feet, and made directly towards our bed. As this creature\\r\\nis reckoned in our country a common vehicle for the devil and witches\\r\\nto play their pranks in, I verily believed we were haunted; and, in a\\r\\nviolent fright, shrank under the bedclothes. This terrible apparition\\r\\nleaped upon the bed, and after giving us several severe dabs with its\\r\\nbeak through the blankets, hopped away, and vanished. Strap and I\\r\\nrecommended ourselves to the protection of heaven with great devotion,\\r\\nand, when we no longer heard the noise, ventured to peep up and take\\r\\nbreath. But we had not been long freed from this phantom, when another\\r\\nappeared, that had well nigh deprived us both of our senses. We\\r\\nperceived an old man enter the room, with a long white beard that\\r\\nreached to his middle; there was a certain wild peculiarity in his eyes\\r\\nand countenance that did not savour of this world; and his dress\\r\\nconsisted of a brown stuff coat, buttoned behind and at the wrists,\\r\\nwith an odd-fashioned cap of the same stuff upon his head. I was so\\r\\namazed that I had not power to move my eyes from such a ghastly object,\\r\\nbut lay motionless and saw him come straight up to me: when he reached\\r\\nthe bed, he wrung his hands, and cried, with a voice that did not seem\\r\\nto belong to a human creature, â\\x80\\x9cWhere is Ralph?â\\x80\\x9d I made no reply: upon\\r\\nwhich he repeated, in an accent still more preternatural, â\\x80\\x9cWhere is\\r\\nRalpho?â\\x80\\x9d He had no sooner pronounced these words than I heard the sound\\r\\nof the bells at a distance; which the apparition, having listened to,\\r\\ntripped away, and left me almost petrified with fear. It was a good\\r\\nwhile before I could recover myself so far as to speak; and, when at\\r\\nlength I turned to Strap, I found him in a fit, which, however, did not\\r\\nlast long. When he came to himself, I asked his opinion of what had\\r\\nhappened; and he assured me that the first must certainly be the soul\\r\\nof some person damned, which appeared by the chain about his legs (for\\r\\nhis fears had magnified the creature to the bigness of a horse, and the\\r\\nsound of small morice-bells to the clanking of massy chains). As for\\r\\nthe old man, he took it to be the spirit of somebody murdered long ago\\r\\nin this place, which had power granted to forment the assassin in the\\r\\nshape of a raven, and that Ralpho was the name of the said murderer.\\r\\nAlthough I had not much faith in this interpretation, I was too much\\r\\ntroubled to enjoy any sleep: and in all my future adventures never\\r\\npassed a night so ill.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning Strap imparted the whole affair to Joey, who, after an\\r\\nimmoderate fit of laughter, explained the matter, by telling him that\\r\\nthe old man was the landlordâ\\x80\\x99s father, who had been an idiot some\\r\\nyears, and diverted himself with a tame raven, which, it seems, had\\r\\nhopped away from his apartment in the night, and induced him to follow\\r\\nit to our chamber, where he had inquired after it under the name of\\r\\nRalpho.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey,\\r\\nwhich continued six or seven days longer: at length we entered the\\r\\ngreat city, and lodged all night at the inn where the waggon put up.\\r\\nNext morning all the passengers parted different ways, while my\\r\\ncompanion and I sallied out to inquire for the member of parliament, to\\r\\nwhom I had a letter of recommendation from Mr. Crab. As we had\\r\\ndischarged our lodging at the inn, Strap took up our baggage and,\\r\\nmarched behind me in the street with the knapsack on his back, as\\r\\nusual, so that we made a very whimsical appearance. I had dressed\\r\\nmyself to the greatest advantage; that is, put on a clean ruffled\\r\\nshirt, and my best thread stockings: my hair (which was of the deepest\\r\\nred) hung down upon my shoulders, as lank and straight as a pound of\\r\\ncandles; and the skirts of my coat reached to the middle of my leg; my\\r\\nwaistcoat and breeches were of the same piece, and cut in the same\\r\\ntaste; and my hat very much resembled a barberâ\\x80\\x99s basin, in the\\r\\nshallowness of the crown and narrowness of the brim. Strap was habited\\r\\nin a much less awkward manner: but a short crop-eared wig, that very\\r\\nmuch resembled Scrubâ\\x80\\x99s in the play, and the knapsack on his back, added\\r\\nto what is called a queer phiz, occasioned by a long chin, a hook nose,\\r\\nand high cheek bones, rendered him, on the whole, a very fit subject of\\r\\nmirth and pleasantry. As he walked along, Strap, at my desire, inquired\\r\\nof a carman, whom we met, whereabouts Mr. Cringer lived: and was\\r\\nanswered by a stare, accompanied with the word â\\x80\\x9cAnan!â\\x80\\x9d Upon which I\\r\\ncame up, in order to explain the question, but had the misfortune to be\\r\\nunintelligible likewise, the carman damning us for a lousy Scotch\\r\\nguard, whipping his horses with a â\\x80\\x9cGee ho!â\\x80\\x9d which nettled me to the\\r\\nquick, and roused the indignation of Strap so far that, after the\\r\\nfellow was gone a good way, he told me he would fight him for a\\r\\nfarthing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we were deliberating upon what was to be done, a hackney\\r\\ncoachman, driving softly along, and perceiving us standing by the\\r\\nkennel, came up close to us, and calling, â\\x80\\x9cA coach, master!â\\x80\\x9d by a\\r\\ndexterous management of the reins made his horses stumble in the wet,\\r\\nand bedaub us all over with mud. After which exploit he drove on,\\r\\napplauding himself with a hearty laugh, in which several people joined,\\r\\nto my great mortification; but one, more compassionate than the rest,\\r\\nseeing us strangers, advised me to go into an alehouse, and dry myself.\\r\\nI thanked him for his advice, which I immediately complied with; and,\\r\\ngoing into the house he pointed out, called for a pot of beer, and sat\\r\\ndown by a fire in the public room where we cleaned ourselves as well as\\r\\nwe could. In the meantime, a wag, who sat in a box, smoking his pipe,\\r\\nunderstanding, by our dialect, that we were from Scotland, came up to\\r\\nme and, with a grave countenance asked how long I had been caught. As I\\r\\ndid not know the meaning of this question, I made no answer; and he\\r\\nwent on, saying it could not be a great while, for my tail was not yet\\r\\ncut; at the same time taking hold of my hair, and tipping the wink to\\r\\nthe rest of the company, who seemed highly entertained with his wit. I\\r\\nwas incensed at this usage, but afraid of resenting it, because I\\r\\nhappened to be in a strange place, and perceived the person who spoke\\r\\nto me was a brawny fellow, for whom I thought myself by no means a\\r\\nmatch. However, Strap, having either more courage or less caution,\\r\\ncould not put up with the insults I suffered, but told him in a\\r\\nperemptory tone, â\\x80\\x9cHe was an uncivil fellow for making so free with his\\r\\nbetters.â\\x80\\x9d Then the wit going toward him, asked him what he had got in\\r\\nhis knapsack? â\\x80\\x9cIs it oatmeal or brimstone, Sawney?â\\x80\\x9d said he, seizing\\r\\nhim by the chin, which he shook, to the inexpressible diversion of all\\r\\npresent. My companion, feeling himself assaulted in such an opprobrious\\r\\nmanner, disengaged himself in a trice, and lent his antagonist such a\\r\\nbox on the ear as made him stagger to the other side of the room; and,\\r\\nin a moment, a ring was formed for the combatants. Seeing Strap\\r\\nbeginning to strip, and my blood being heated with indignation, which\\r\\nbanished all other thoughts, I undressed myself to the skin in an\\r\\ninstant, and declared, that as the affront that occasioned the quarrel\\r\\nwas offered to me, I would fight it out myself; upon which one or two\\r\\ncried out, â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a brave Scotch boy; you shall have fair play.â\\x80\\x9d His\\r\\nassurance gave me fresh spirits, and, going up to my adversary, who by\\r\\nhis pale countenance did not seem much inclined to the battle, I struck\\r\\nhim so hard on the stomach, that he reeled over a bench, and fell to\\r\\nthe ground. Then I attempted to keep him down, in order to improve my\\r\\nsuccess, according to the manner of my own country, but was restrained\\r\\nby the spectators, one of whom endeavoured to raise up my opponent, but\\r\\nin vain; for he protested he would not fight, for he was not quite\\r\\nrecovered of a late illness. I was very well pleased with this excuse,\\r\\nand immediately dressed myself, having acquired the good opinion of the\\r\\ncompany for my bravery, as well as of my comrade Strap, who shook me by\\r\\nthe hand, and wished me joy of the victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having drunk our pot, and dried our clothes, we inquired of the\\r\\nlandlord if he knew Mr. Cringer, the member of parliament, and were\\r\\namazed at his replying in the negative; for we imagined he must be\\r\\naltogether as conspicuous here as in the borough he represented; but he\\r\\ntold us we might possibly hear of him as we passed along. We betook\\r\\nourselves therefore to the street, where seeing a footman standing at\\r\\nthe door, we made up to him, and asked if he knew where our patron\\r\\nlived? This member of the particoloured fraternity, surveying us both\\r\\nvery minutely, said he knew Mr. Cringer very well, and bade us turn\\r\\ndown the first street on our left, then turn to the right, and then to\\r\\nthe left again, after which perambulation we would observe a lane,\\r\\nthrough which we must pass, and at the other end we should find an\\r\\nalley that leads to another street, where we should see the sign of the\\r\\nThistle and Three Pedlars, and there he lodged. We thanked him for his\\r\\ninformation, and went forwards, Strap telling me, that he knew this\\r\\nperson to be an honest friendly man by his countenance, before he\\r\\nopened his mouth; in which opinion I acquiesced, ascribing his good\\r\\nmanners to the company he daily saw in the house where he served.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe followed his directions punctually, in turning to the left, and to\\r\\nthe right, and to the left again; but instead of seeing a lane before\\r\\nus, found ourselves at the side of the river, a circumstance that\\r\\nperplexed us not a little; and my fellow-traveller ventured to\\r\\npronounce, that we had certainly missed our way. By this time we were\\r\\npretty much fatigued with our walk, and not knowing how to proceed, I\\r\\nwent into a small snuff-shop hard by, encouraged by the sign of the\\r\\nHighlander, where I found, to my inexpressible satisfaction, the\\r\\nshopkeeper was my countryman. He was no sooner informed of our\\r\\nperegrination, and the directions we had received from the footman,\\r\\nthan he informed us we had been imposed upon, telling us, Mr. Cringer\\r\\nlived in the other end of the town and that it would be to no purpose\\r\\nfor us to go thither to-day, for by that time he was gone to the House.\\r\\nI then asked, if he could recommend us a lodging. He really gave us a\\r\\nline to one of his acquaintance who kept a chandlerâ\\x80\\x99s shop not far from\\r\\nSt. Martinâ\\x80\\x99s Lane; there we hired a bed-room, up two pair of stairs, at\\r\\nthe rate of two shillings per week, so very small, that when the bed\\r\\nwas let down, we were obliged to carry out every other piece of\\r\\nfurniture that belonged to the apartment, and use the bedstead by way\\r\\nof chairs. About dinner-time, our landlord asked how we proposed to\\r\\nlive? to which interrogation we answered, that we would be directed by\\r\\nhim. â\\x80\\x9cWell, then,â\\x80\\x9d says he, â\\x80\\x9cthere are two ways of eating in this town\\r\\nfor people of your conditionâ\\x80\\x94the one more creditable and expensive than\\r\\nthe other: the first is to dine at an eating-house frequented by\\r\\nwell-dressed people only; and the other is called diving, practised by\\r\\nthose who are either obliged or inclined to live frugally.â\\x80\\x9d I gave him\\r\\nto understand that, provided the last was not infamous, it would suit\\r\\nmuch better with our circumstances than the other. â\\x80\\x9cInfamous!â\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\nhe, â\\x80\\x9cnot at all; there are many creditable people, rich people, ay, and\\r\\nfine people, that dive every day. I have seen many a pretty gentleman\\r\\nwith a laced waistcoat dine in that manner very comfortably for three\\r\\npence halfpenny, and go afterwards to the coffee-house, where he made a\\r\\nfigure with the best lord in the land; but your own eyes shall bear\\r\\nwitnessâ\\x80\\x94I will go along with you to-day and introduce you.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe accordingly conducted us to a certain lane, where stopping, he bade\\r\\nus observe him, and do as he did, and, walking a few paces, dived into\\r\\na cellar and disappeared in an instant. I followed his example, and\\r\\ndescending very successfully, found myself in the middle of a cookâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nshop, almost suffocated with the steams of boiled beef, and surrounded\\r\\nby a company of hackney coachmen, chairmen, draymen, and a few footmen\\r\\nout of place or on board-wages; who sat eating shin of beef, tripe,\\r\\ncow-heel, or sausages, at separate boards, covered with cloths which\\r\\nturned my stomach. While I stood in amaze, undetermined whether to sit\\r\\ndown or walk upwards again, Strap, in his descent, missing one of the\\r\\nstops, tumbled headlong into this infernal ordinary, and overturned the\\r\\ncook as she carried a porringer of soup to one of the guests. In her\\r\\nfall, she dashed the whole mess against the legs of a drummer belonging\\r\\nto the foot-guards, who happened to be in her way, and scalded him so\\r\\nmiserably, that he started up, and danced up and down, uttering a\\r\\nvolley of execrations that made my hair stand on end.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he entertained the company in this manner, with an eloquence\\r\\npeculiar to himself, the cook got up, and after a hearty curse on the\\r\\npoor author of this mischance, who lay under the table with a woful\\r\\ncountenance, emptied a salt-cellar in her hand, and, stripping down the\\r\\npatientâ\\x80\\x99s stocking, which brought the skin along with it, applied the\\r\\ncontents to the sore. This poultice was scarce laid on, when the\\r\\ndrummer, who had begun to abate of his exclamations, broke forth into\\r\\nsuch a hideous yell as made the whole company tremble, then, seizing a\\r\\npewter pint pot that stood by him, squeezed the sides of it together,\\r\\nas if it had been made of pliant leather, grinding his teeth at the\\r\\nsame time with a most horrible grin. Guessing the cause of this violent\\r\\ntransport, I bade the woman wash off the salt, and bathe the part with\\r\\noil, which she did, and procured him immediate ease. But here another\\r\\ndifficulty occurred, which was no other than the landladyâ\\x80\\x99s insisting\\r\\non his paying for the pot he had rendered useless. He said, he would\\r\\npay for nothing but what he had eaten, and bade her be thankful for his\\r\\nmoderation, or else he would prosecute her for damages. Strap,\\r\\nforeseeing the whole affair would lie at his door, promised to satisfy\\r\\nthe cook, and called for a dram of gin to treat the drummer, which\\r\\nentirely appeased him, and composed all animosities. After this\\r\\naccommodation, our landlord and we sat down at a board, and dined upon\\r\\nshin of beef most deliciously; our reckoning amounting to twopence\\r\\nhalfpenny each, bread and small beer included.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe visit Strapâ\\x80\\x99s friendâ\\x80\\x94a description of himâ\\x80\\x94his adviceâ\\x80\\x94we go to Mr.\\r\\nCringerâ\\x80\\x99s houseâ\\x80\\x94are denied admittanceâ\\x80\\x94an Accident befalls Strapâ\\x80\\x94his\\r\\nbehaviour thereuponâ\\x80\\x94an extraordinary adventure occurs, in the course of\\r\\nwhich I lose all my money\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon my companion proposed to call at his friendâ\\x80\\x99s house,\\r\\nwhich, we were informed, was in the neighbourhood, whither we\\r\\naccordingly went, and were so lucky as to find him at home. This\\r\\ngentleman, who had come from Scotland three or four years before, kept\\r\\na school in town, where he taught the Latin, French, and Italian\\r\\nlanguages; but what he chiefly professed was the pronunciation of the\\r\\nEnglish tongue, after a method more speedy and uncommon than any\\r\\npractised heretofore, and, indeed, if his scholars spoke like their\\r\\nmaster, the latter part of his undertaking was certainly performed to a\\r\\ntittle: for although I could easily understand every word of what I had\\r\\nheard hitherto since I entered England, three parts in four of his\\r\\ndialect were as unintelligible to me as if he had spoken in Arabic or\\r\\nIrish. He was a middle-sized man, and stooped very much, though not\\r\\nabove the age of forty; his face was frightfully pitted with the\\r\\nsmall-pox, and his mouth extended from ear to ear. He was dressed in a\\r\\nnight-gown of plaid, fastened about his middle with a sergeantâ\\x80\\x99s old\\r\\nsash, and a tie-periwig with a foretop three inches high, in the\\r\\nfashion of King Charles the Secondâ\\x80\\x99s reign.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter he had received Strap, who was related to him, very courteously,\\r\\nhe inquired of him who I was; and being informed, he took me by the\\r\\nhand, telling me he was at school with my father. When he understood my\\r\\nsituation, he assured me that he would do me all the service in his\\r\\npower, both by his advice and otherwise, and while he spoke these words\\r\\neyed me with great attention, walking round me several times, and\\r\\nmuttering, â\\x80\\x9cOh, dear! Oh, dear! fat a saight is here!â\\x80\\x9d I soon guessed\\r\\nthe reason of his ejaculation, and said, â\\x80\\x9cI suppose, sir, you are not\\r\\npleased with my dress.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDress,â\\x80\\x9d answered he, â\\x80\\x9cyou may caal it fat you\\r\\nplease in your country, but I vow to Gad â\\x80\\x99tis a masquerade here. No\\r\\nChristian will admit such a figure into his house. Upon my conscience,\\r\\nI wonder the dogs did not hunt you. Did you pass through St. Jamesâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmarket? Bless my eyesaight! you are like a cousin-german of an\\r\\nourangoutang.â\\x80\\x9d I began to be a little serious at this discourse, and\\r\\nasked him, if he thought I should obtain entrance to-morrow at the\\r\\nhouse of Mr. Cringer, on whom I chiefly depended for an introduction\\r\\ninto business? â\\x80\\x9cMr. Cringer, Mr. Cringer,â\\x80\\x9d replied he, scratching his\\r\\ncheek, â\\x80\\x9cmay be a very honest gentlemanâ\\x80\\x94I know nothing to the contrary;\\r\\nbut is your sole dependence upon him? Who recommended you to him?â\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\npulled out Mr. Crabâ\\x80\\x99s letter, and told him the foundation of my hopes,\\r\\nat which he stared at me, and repeated â\\x80\\x9cOh dear! Oh dear!â\\x80\\x9d I began to\\r\\nconceive bad omens from this behaviour of his, and begged he would\\r\\nassist me with his advice, which he promised to give very frankly; and\\r\\nas a specimen, directed us to a periwig warehouse in the neighbourhood,\\r\\nin order to be accommodated; laying strong injunctions on me not to\\r\\nappear before Mr. Cringer till I had parted with my carroty locks,\\r\\nwhich, he said, were sufficient to beget an antipathy against me in all\\r\\nmankind. And as we were going to pursue this advice, he called me back\\r\\nand bade me be sure to deliver my letter into Mr. Cringerâ\\x80\\x99s own hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we walked along, Strap triumphed greatly in our reception with his\\r\\nfriend, who, it seems, had assured him he would in a day or two provide\\r\\nfor him with some good master; â\\x80\\x9cI and now,â\\x80\\x9d says he, â\\x80\\x9cI you will see\\r\\nhow I will fit you with a wig. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s neâ\\x80\\x99er a barber in London (and\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s a bold word) can palm a rotten caul, or a pennyweight of dead\\r\\nhair, upon me.â\\x80\\x9d And, indeed, this zealous adherent did wrangle so long\\r\\nwith the merchant, that he was desired twenty times to leave the shop,\\r\\nand see if he could get one cheaper elsewhere. At length I made choice\\r\\n(if a good handsome bob), for which I paid ten shillings, and returned\\r\\nto our lodging, where Strap in a moment rid me of that hair which had\\r\\ngiven the schoolmaster so much offence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got up next day betimes, having been informed that Mr. Cringer gave\\r\\naudience by candle-light to all his dependents, he himself being\\r\\nobliged to attend the levee of my Lord Terrier at break of day, because\\r\\nhis lordship made one at the ministerâ\\x80\\x99s between eight and nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock.\\r\\nWhen we came to Mr. Cringerâ\\x80\\x99s door, Strap, to give me all instance of\\r\\nhis politeness, ran to the knocker, which he employed so loud and so\\r\\nlong, that he alarmed the whole street; and a window opening in the\\r\\nsecond story of the next house, a vessel was discharged upon him so\\r\\nsuccessfully, that the poor barber was wet to the skin, while I, being\\r\\nluckily at some distance, escaped the unsavoury deluge. In the\\r\\nmeantime, a footman opening the door, and seeing nobody in the street\\r\\nbut us, asked, with a stern countenance, if it was I who made such a\\r\\nnoise, and what I wanted. I told him I had business with his master,\\r\\nwhom I desired to see. Upon which he slapped the door in my face,\\r\\ntelling me I must learn better manners before I could have access to\\r\\nhis master. Vexed at this disappointment, I turned my resentment\\r\\nagainst Strap, whom I sharply reprimanded for his presumption; but he,\\r\\nnot in the least regarding what I said, wrung the wet out of his\\r\\nperiwig, and lifting up a large stone, flung it with such force against\\r\\nthe street door of that house from whence he had been bedewed, that the\\r\\nlock giving way, it flew wide open, and he took to his heels, leaving\\r\\nme to follow him as I could. Indeed, there was no time for\\r\\ndeliberation; I therefore pursued him with all the speed I could exert,\\r\\nuntil we found ourselves about the dawn in a street we did not know.\\r\\nHere, as we wandered along gaping about, a very decent sort of a man,\\r\\npassing by me, stopped of a sudden and took up something, which having\\r\\nexamined, he turned and presented to me with these words: â\\x80\\x9cSir, you\\r\\nhave dropped half-a-crown.â\\x80\\x9d I was not a little surprised at this\\r\\ninstance of honesty, and told him it did not belong to me; but he bade\\r\\nme recollect, and see if all my money was safe; upon which I pulled out\\r\\nmy purse, for I had bought one since I came to town, and, reckoning my\\r\\nmoney in my hand, which was now reduced to five guineas seven shillings\\r\\nand twopence, assured him I had lost nothing. â\\x80\\x9cWell, then, says he, so\\r\\nmuch the better; this is a godsend, and as you two were present when I\\r\\npicked it up, you are entitled to equal shares with me.â\\x80\\x9d I was\\r\\nastonished at these words, and looked upon this person to be a prodigy\\r\\nof integrity, but absolutely refused to take any part of the sum.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cyou are too modestâ\\x80\\x94I see you are\\r\\nstrangers, but you shall give me leave to treat you with a whet this\\r\\ncold raw morning.â\\x80\\x9d I would have declined the invitation, but Strap\\r\\nwhispered to me that the gentleman would be affronted, and I complied.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere shall we go?â\\x80\\x9d said the stranger; â\\x80\\x9cI am quite ignorant of this\\r\\npart of the town.â\\x80\\x9d I informed him that we were in the same situation;\\r\\nupon which he proposed to go into the first public-house we should find\\r\\nopen; and as we walked together, he began in this manner: â\\x80\\x9cI find by\\r\\nyour tongues you are from Scotland, gentlemen; my grandmother by the\\r\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s side was of your country, and I am so prepossessed in its\\r\\nfavour, that I never meet a Scotchman but my heart warms. The Scots are\\r\\nvery brave people. There is scarce a great family in the kingdom that\\r\\ncannot boast of some exploits performed by its ancestors many hundred\\r\\nyears ago. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s your Douglasses, Gordons, Campbells, Hamiltons. We\\r\\nhave no such ancient families here in England. Then you are all very\\r\\nwell educated. I have known a pedlar talk in Greek and Hebrew as well\\r\\nas if they had been his mother-tongue. And for honestyâ\\x80\\x94I once had a\\r\\nservant, his name was Gregor Macgregor, I would have trusted him with\\r\\nuntold gold.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis eulogium of my native country gained my affections so strongly,\\r\\nthat I believe I could have gone to death to serve the author; and\\r\\nStrapâ\\x80\\x99s eyes swam in tears. At length, as we passed through a dark\\r\\nnarrow lane, we perceived a public-house, which we entered, and found a\\r\\nman sitting by the fire, smoking a pipe, with a pint of purl before\\r\\nhim. Our new acquaintance asked us if ever we had drunk egg-flip? To\\r\\nwhich question we answering in the negative, he assured us of a regale,\\r\\nand ordered a quart to be prepared, calling for pipes and tobacco at\\r\\nthe same time. We found this composition very palateable, and drank\\r\\nheartily; the conversation, which was introduced by the gentleman,\\r\\nturning upon the snares that young inexperienced people are exposed to\\r\\nin this metropolis. He described a thousand cheats that are daily\\r\\npractised upon the ignorant and unwary, and warned us of them with so\\r\\nmuch good nature and concern, that we blessed the opportunity which\\r\\nthrew us in his way. After we had put the can about for some time, our\\r\\nnew friend began to yawn, telling us he had been up all night with a\\r\\nsick person; and proposed we should have recourse to some diversion to\\r\\nkeep him awake. â\\x80\\x9cSuppose,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cwe should take a hand at whist for\\r\\npastime. But let me see: that wonâ\\x80\\x99t do, thereâ\\x80\\x99s only three of us; and I\\r\\ncannot play at any other game. The truth is, I seldom or never play,\\r\\nbut out of complaisance, or at such a time as this, when I am in danger\\r\\nof falling asleep.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I was not much inclined to gaming, I felt no aversion to pass\\r\\nan hour or two at cards with a friend; and knowing that Strap\\r\\nunderstood as much of the matter as I, made no scruple of saying, â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nwish we could find a fourth hand.â\\x80\\x9d While we were in this perplexity the\\r\\nperson whom we found in the house at our entrance, overhearing our\\r\\ndiscourse, took the pipe from his mouth very gravely, and accosted us\\r\\nthus: â\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, my pipe is out, you see,â\\x80\\x9d shaking the ashes into the\\r\\nfire, â\\x80\\x9cand rather than you should be balked, I donâ\\x80\\x99t care if I take a\\r\\nhand with you for a trifleâ\\x80\\x94but remember I wonâ\\x80\\x99t play for anything of\\r\\nconsequence.â\\x80\\x9d We accepted his proffer with pleasure. Having cut for\\r\\npartners, it fell to my lot to play with him against our friend and\\r\\nStrap, for threepence a game. We were so successful, that in a short\\r\\ntime I was half-a-crown gainer; when the gentleman whom we had met in\\r\\nthe street observing he had no luck to-day, proposed to leave off, or\\r\\nchange partners. By this time I was inflamed with my good fortune and\\r\\nthe expectation of improving it, as I perceived the two strangers\\r\\nplayed but indifferently; therefore I voted for giving him his revenge:\\r\\nand cutting again, Strap and I, to our mutual satisfaction, happened to\\r\\nbe partners. My good fortune attended me still, and in less than an\\r\\nhour we had got thirty shillings of their money, for as they lost they\\r\\ngrew the keener, and doubled stakes every time. At last the inconstant\\r\\ngoddess began to veer about, and we were very soon stripped of all our\\r\\ngains, and about forty shillings of our own money. This loss mortified\\r\\nme extremely, and had a visible effect on the muscles of Strapâ\\x80\\x99s face,\\r\\nwhich lengthened apace; but our antagonists perceiving our condition,\\r\\nkindly permitted us to retrieve our loss, and console ourselves with a\\r\\nnew acquisition. Then my companion wisely suggested it was time to be\\r\\ngone; upon which the person who had joined us in the house began to\\r\\ncurse the cards, and muttered that we were indebted to fortune only for\\r\\nwhat we had got, no part of our success being owing to our good play.\\r\\nThis insinuation nettled me so much that I challenged him to a game at\\r\\npiquet for a crown: and he was with difficulty persuaded to accept the\\r\\ninvitation. This contest ended in less than an hour to my inexpressible\\r\\naffliction, who lost every shilling of my own money, Strap absolutely\\r\\nrefusing to supply me with a sixpence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleman at whose request we had come in, perceiving by my\\r\\ndisconsolate looks the situation of my heart, which well nigh burst\\r\\nwith grief and resentment, when the other stranger got up, and went\\r\\naway with my money, began in this manner:â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cI am truly afflicted at your\\r\\nbad luck, and would willingly repair it, were it in my power. But what\\r\\nin the name of goodness could provoke you to tempt your fate so long?\\r\\nIt is always a maxim with gamesters to pursue success as far us it will\\r\\ngo, and to stop whenever fortune shifts about. You are a young man, and\\r\\nyour passions are too impetuous; you must learn to govern them better.\\r\\nHowever, there is no experience like that which is bought; you will be\\r\\nthe better for this the longest day you have to live. As for the fellow\\r\\nwho has got your money, I donâ\\x80\\x99t half like him. Did not you see me tip\\r\\nyou the wink to leave off in time?â\\x80\\x9d I answered, â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d continued\\r\\nhe; â\\x80\\x9cyou was too eager to mind anything but the game. But, harkee,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid he in a whisper, â\\x80\\x9care you satisfied of that young manâ\\x80\\x99s honesty?\\r\\nHis looks are a little suspiciousâ\\x80\\x94but I may be mistaken; he made a\\r\\ngreat many grimaces while he stood behind you, this is a very wicked\\r\\ntown.â\\x80\\x9d I told him I was very well convinced of my comradeâ\\x80\\x99s integrity\\r\\nand, that the grimaces he mentioned were doubtless owing to his anxiety\\r\\nof my loss. â\\x80\\x9cOh ho! if that be the case, I ask his pardon. Landlord,\\r\\nsee whatâ\\x80\\x99s to pay.â\\x80\\x9d The reckoning amounted to eighteenpence, which,\\r\\nhaving discharged, the gentleman shook us both by the hand, and, saying\\r\\nhe should be very glad to see us again, departed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStrap moralisesâ\\x80\\x94presents his purse to meâ\\x80\\x94we inform our landlord of our\\r\\nmisfortuneâ\\x80\\x94he unravels the mysteryâ\\x80\\x94I present myself to Cringerâ\\x80\\x94he\\r\\nrecommends and turns me over to Mr. Staytapeâ\\x80\\x94I become acquainted with a\\r\\nfellow dependent, who explains the character of Cringer and\\r\\nStaytapeâ\\x80\\x94and informs me of the method to be pursued at the Navy Office\\r\\nand Surgeonsâ\\x80\\x99 Hallâ\\x80\\x94Strap is employed\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our way to our lodging, after a profound silence on both sides,\\r\\nStrap, with a hideous groan, observed that we had brought our pigs to a\\r\\nfine market. To this observation I made no reply, and he went on: â\\x80\\x9cGod\\r\\nsend us well out of this place; we have not been in London eight and\\r\\nforty hours, and I believe we have met with eight and forty thousand\\r\\nmisfortunes. We have been jeered, reproached, buffeted, and at last\\r\\nstript of our money; and I suppose by and bye we shall be stript of our\\r\\nskins. Indeed as to the money part of it, that was owing to our own\\r\\nfolly.â\\x80\\x94Solomon says, â\\x80\\x98Bray a fool in a mortar, and he will never be\\r\\nwise.â\\x80\\x99 Ah! God help us, an ounce of prudence is worth a pound of gold.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThis was no time for him to tamper with my disposition, already mad\\r\\nwith my loss, and inflamed with resentment against him for having\\r\\nrefused me a little money to attempt to retrieve it. I therefore turned\\r\\ntowards him with a stern countenance, and asked, who he called fool?\\r\\nBeing altogether unaccustomed to such looks from me, he stood still,\\r\\nand stared in my face for some time; then, with some confusion,\\r\\nuttered, â\\x80\\x9cFool! I called nobody fool but myself; I am sure I am the\\r\\ngreatest fool of the two, for being so much concerned at other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmisfortunes; but â\\x80\\x98Nemo omnibus horis sapitâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s all, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nUpon which a silence ensued, which brought us to our lodging, where I\\r\\nthrew myself upon the bed in an agony of despair, resolved to perish\\r\\nrather than apply to my companion, or any other body, for relief; but\\r\\nStrap, who knew my temper, and whose heart bled within him for my\\r\\ndistress, after some pause came to the bedside, and, putting a leathern\\r\\npurse into my hand, burst into tears, crying, â\\x80\\x9cI know what you think,\\r\\nbut I scorn your thought. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s all I have in the world, take it, and\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll perhaps get more for you before that be done. If not, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll beg for\\r\\nyou, steal for you, go through the wide world with you, and stay with\\r\\nyou; for though I be a poor cobblerâ\\x80\\x99s son, I am no scout.â\\x80\\x9d I was so\\r\\nmuch touched with the generous passion of this poor creature, that I\\r\\ncould not refrain from weeping also, and we mingled our tears together\\r\\nfor some time. Upon examining the purse, I found in it two half-guineas\\r\\nand half-a-crown, which I would have returned to him, saying, he knew\\r\\nbetter than I how to manage it, but he, absolutely refused my proposal\\r\\nand told me it was more reasonable and decent that he should depend\\r\\nupon me, who was a gentleman, than that I should be controlled by him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this friendly contest was over, and our minds more at ease, we\\r\\ninformed our landlord of what had happened to us, taking care to\\r\\nconceal the extremity to which we were reduced. He no sooner heard the\\r\\nstory, than he assured us we had been grievously imposed upon by a\\r\\ncouple of sharpers, who were associates; and that this polite, honest,\\r\\nfriendly, humane person, who had treated us so civilly, was no other\\r\\nthan a rascally money-dropper, who made it his business to decoy\\r\\nstrangers in that manner to one of his own haunts, where an accomplice\\r\\nor two were always waiting to assist in pillaging the prey he had run\\r\\ndown. Here the good man recounted a great many stories of people who\\r\\nhas been seduced, cheated, pilfered, beatâ\\x80\\x94nay, even murdered by such\\r\\nvillains. I was confounded at the artifice and wickedness of mankind;\\r\\nand Strap, lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, prayed that God\\r\\nwould deliver him from such scenes of iniquity, for surely the devil\\r\\nhad set up his throne in London. Our landlord being curious to know\\r\\nwhat reception we had met with at Mr. Cringerâ\\x80\\x99s, we acquainted him with\\r\\nthe particulars, at which he shook his head, and told us we had not\\r\\ngone the right way to work; that there was nothing to be done with a\\r\\nmember of parliament without a bribe; that the servant was commonly\\r\\ninfected with the masterâ\\x80\\x99s disease, and expected to be paid for his\\r\\nwork, as well as his betters. He therefore advised me to give the\\r\\nfootman a shilling the next time I should desire admittance to my\\r\\npatron, or else I should scarce find an opportunity to deliver my\\r\\nletter. Accordingly, next morning, when the door was opened, I slipped\\r\\na shilling into his hand, and told him I had a letter for his master. I\\r\\nfound the good effect of my liberality; for the fellow let me in\\r\\nimmediately, and, taking the letter out of my hand, desired me to wait\\r\\nin a kind of passage for an answer. In this place I continued standing\\r\\nfor three-quarters-of-an-hour, during which time I saw a great many\\r\\nyoung fellows whom I formerly knew in Scotland pass and repass, with an\\r\\nair of familiarity, in their way to and from the audience-chamber;\\r\\nwhile I was fain to stand shivering in the cold, and turn my back to\\r\\nthem that they might not perceive the lowness of my condition. At\\r\\nlength, Mr. Cringer came out to see a young gentleman to the door, who\\r\\nwas no other than Squire Gawky, dressed in a very gay suit of clothes;\\r\\nat parting Mr. Cringer shook him by the hand and told him he hoped to\\r\\nhave the pleasure of his company at dinner. Then turning about towards\\r\\nme, asked what were my commands? When he understood I was the person\\r\\nwho had brought the letter from Mr. Crab, he affected to recollect my\\r\\nname, which, however, he pretended he could not do till he had\\r\\nconsulted the letter again; to save him the trouble, I told him my name\\r\\nwas Random. Upon which he went on, â\\x80\\x9cAy, ay, Random, Random, Randomâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nthink I remember the name:â\\x80\\x9d and very well he might, for this very\\r\\nindividual, Mr. Cringer, had many a time rode before my grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncloak-bag, in quality of a footman. â\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d says he, â\\x80\\x9cyou propose to go\\r\\non board a man-of-war as surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s mate.â\\x80\\x9d I replied by a low bow. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nbelieve it will be a difficult matter,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, â\\x80\\x9cto procure a\\r\\nwarrant, there being already such a swarm of Scotch surgeons at the\\r\\nNavy Office, in expectation of the next vacancy, that the commissioners\\r\\nare afraid of being torn to pieces, and have actually applied for a\\r\\nguard to protect them. However, some ships will soon be put in\\r\\ncommission, and then we shall see whatâ\\x80\\x99s to be done.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he\\r\\nleft me, exceedingly mortified at the different reception Mr. Gawky and\\r\\nI had met with from this upstart, proud, mean member, who, I imagined,\\r\\nwould have been glad of an opportunity to be grateful for the\\r\\nobligations he owed to my family.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt my return, I was surprised with the agreeable news of Strapâ\\x80\\x99s being\\r\\nemployed, on the recommendation of his friend, the schoolmaster, by a\\r\\nperiwig-maker in the neighbourhood, who allowed him five shillings per\\r\\nweek besides bed and board. I continued to dance attendance every other\\r\\nmorning at the levee of Mr. Cringer, during a fortnight; in which time\\r\\nI became acquainted with a young fellow of my own country and\\r\\nprofession, who also depended on the memberâ\\x80\\x99s interest, but was treated\\r\\nwith much more respect than I, both by the servants and master, and\\r\\noften admitted into a parlour, where there was a fire for the\\r\\nconvenience of the better sort of those who waited for him. Thither I\\r\\nwas never permitted to penetrate, on account of my appearance, which\\r\\nwas not at all fashionable; but was obliged to stand blowing my fingers\\r\\nin a cold lobby, and take the first opportunity of Mr. Cringerâ\\x80\\x99s going\\r\\nto the door to speak with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, while I enjoyed this occasion a person was introduced, whom\\r\\nMr. Cringer no sooner saw, than, running towards him, he saluted him\\r\\nwith a low bow to the very ground, and afterwards shaking him by the\\r\\nhand with great heartiness and familiarity, called him his good friend,\\r\\nand asked very kindly after Mrs. Staytape and the young ladies; then,\\r\\nafter a whisper, which continued some minutes, wherein I overheard the\\r\\nword â\\x80\\x98honourâ\\x80\\x99 repeated several times with great emphasis, Mr. Cringer\\r\\nintroduced me to this gentleman, as to a person whose advice and\\r\\nassistance I might depend upon; and having given me his direction,\\r\\nfollowed me to the door, where he told me I need not give myself the\\r\\ntrouble to call at his house any more, for Mr. Staytape would do my\\r\\nbusiness. At that instant my fellow-dependent, coming out after me,\\r\\noverheard the discourse of Mr. Cringer, and, making up to me in the\\r\\nstreet, accosted me very civilly: this address I looked upon as no\\r\\nsmall honour, considering the figure he made, for he was dressed in a\\r\\nblue frock with a button, a green silk waistcoat, trimmed with gold,\\r\\nblack velvet breeches, white silk stockings, silver buckles, a\\r\\ngold-laced hat, a spencer-wig, and a silver-hilted hanger, with a fine\\r\\nclouded can in his hand. â\\x80\\x9cI perceive,â\\x80\\x9d says he, â\\x80\\x9cyou are but lately\\r\\ncome from Scotland; pray what may your business with Mr. Cringer be? I\\r\\nsuppose it is no secret and I may possibly give you some advice that\\r\\nwill be serviceable, for I have been surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s second mate on board of\\r\\na seventy-gun ship, and consequently know a good deal of the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI made no scruple to disclose my situation, which, when he had learned,\\r\\nhe shook his head, and told me he had been pretty much, in the same\\r\\ncircumstances about a year ago: that he had relied on Cringerâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npromises, until his money (which was considerable) as well as his\\r\\ncredit, was quite exhausted; and when he wrote to his relations for a\\r\\nfresh supply, instead of money he received nothing but reproaches, and\\r\\nthe epithets of idle, debauched fellow. That after he had waited at the\\r\\nNavy Office many months for a warrant to no purpose, he was fain to\\r\\npawn some of his clothes, which raised a small sum wherewith he bribed\\r\\nthe secretary, who soon procured a warrant for him, notwithstanding he\\r\\nhad affirmed the same day, that there was not one vacancy. That he had\\r\\ngone on board, where he remained nine months, at the end of which the\\r\\nship was put out of commission, and he said the company were to be paid\\r\\noff in Broad Street the very next day. That relations being reconciled\\r\\nto him, had charged him to pay his devoirs regularly to Mr. Cringer,\\r\\nwho had informed them by letter that his interest alone had procured\\r\\nthe warrant; in obedience to which command he came to his levee every\\r\\nmorning; as I saw, though he looked upon him to be a very pitiful\\r\\nscoundrel. In conclusion, he asked me if I had yet passed at Surgeonsâ\\x80\\x99\\r\\nHall? To which question I answered, I did not so much as know it was\\r\\nnecessary. â\\x80\\x9cNecessary:â\\x80\\x9d cried he, â\\x80\\x9cOh then I find I must instruct you:\\r\\ncome along with me, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll give you information about that matter.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nSo Saying, he carried me into an ale-house, where I called for some\\r\\nbeer, and bread and cheese, on which we breakfasted. While we sat in\\r\\nthis place, he told me I must first go to the Navy Office, and write to\\r\\nthe Board, desiring them to order a letter for me to Surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s Hall,\\r\\nthat I might be examined, touching my skill in surgery. That the\\r\\nsurgeons, after having examined me, would give me my qualification\\r\\nsealed up in form of a letter directed to the commissioners, which\\r\\nqualification I must deliver to the secretary of the Board, who would\\r\\nopen it in my presence, and read the contents; after which I must\\r\\nemploy my interest to be provided for as soon as possible. That the\\r\\nexpense of his qualification for second mate of a third-rate, amounted\\r\\nto thirteen shillings, exclusive of the warrant, which cost him\\r\\nhalf-a-guinea and half-a-crown, besides a present to the secretary,\\r\\nwhich consisted of a three-pound twelve piece. This calculation was\\r\\nlike a thunderbolt to me, whose whole fortune did not amount to twelve\\r\\nshillings. I accordingly made him acquainted with this part of my\\r\\ndistress, after having thanked him for his information and advice. He\\r\\ncondoled me on this occasion; but bade me be of good cheer, for he had\\r\\nconceived a friendship for me, and would make all things easy. He was\\r\\nran out at present, but to-morrow or next day, he was certain of\\r\\nreceiving a considerable sum; of which he would lend me what would be\\r\\nsufficient to answer my exigencies. This frank declaration pleased me\\r\\nso much, that I pulled out my purse, and emptied it before him, begging\\r\\nhim to take what he pleased for pocket-expense, until he should receive\\r\\nhis own money. With a good deal of pressing, he was prevailed upon to\\r\\ntake five shillings telling me that he might have what money he wanted\\r\\nat any time for the trouble of going into the city; but as he had met\\r\\nwith me, he would defer his going thither till tomorrow, when I should\\r\\ngo along with him, and he would put me in the way of acting for myself,\\r\\nwithout a servile dependence on that rascal Cringer, much less on the\\r\\ntailor to whom he heard him turn me over. â\\x80\\x9cHow!â\\x80\\x9d cried I, â\\x80\\x9cis Mr.\\r\\nStaytape a tailor.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo less, I assure you,â\\x80\\x9d answered he, â\\x80\\x9cand, I\\r\\nconfess, more likely to serve you than the member; for, provided you\\r\\ncan entertain him with politics and conundrums, you may have credit\\r\\nwith him for as many and as rich clothes as you please.â\\x80\\x9d I told him, I\\r\\nwas utterly ignorant of both, and so incensed at Cringerâ\\x80\\x99s usage, that\\r\\nI would never set foot within his door again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a good deal more conversation, my new acquaintance and I parted,\\r\\nhaving made an appointment to meet next day at the same place; in order\\r\\nto set out for the city. I went immediately to Strap and related\\r\\neverything which had happened, but he did not at all approve of my\\r\\nbeing so forward to lend money to a stranger, especially as we had\\r\\nalready been so much imposed upon by appearances. â\\x80\\x9cHowever,â\\x80\\x9d said he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif you are sure he is a Scotchman, I believe you are safe.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy new acquaintance breaks an appointmentâ\\x80\\x94I proceed, by myself, to the\\r\\nNavy Officeâ\\x80\\x94address me to a person there, who assists me with\\r\\nadviceâ\\x80\\x94write to the Board, they grant me a letter to the Surgeons at\\r\\nthe Hallâ\\x80\\x94am informed of the beauâ\\x80\\x99s name and characterâ\\x80\\x94find himâ\\x80\\x94he makes\\r\\nme his confidant in an amourâ\\x80\\x94desires me to pawn my linen for his\\r\\noccasionsâ\\x80\\x94recover what I lent himâ\\x80\\x94some curious observations on Strap on\\r\\nthat occasionâ\\x80\\x94his vanity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning I rose and went to the place of rendezvous, where I\\r\\nwaited two hours in vain, and was so exasperated against him for\\r\\nbreaking his appointment, that I set out for the city by myself, in\\r\\nhope of finding the villain, and being revenged on him for his breach\\r\\nof promise. At length I found myself at the Navy Office, which I\\r\\nentered, and saw crowds of young fellows walking below, many of whom\\r\\nmade no better appearance than myself. I consulted the physiognomy of\\r\\neach, and at last made up to one whose countenance I liked, and asked,\\r\\nif he could instruct me in the form of the letter which was to be sent\\r\\nto the Board to obtain an order for examination? He answered me in\\r\\nbroad Scotch, that he would show me the copy of what he had writ for\\r\\nhimself, by direction of another who know the form, and accordingly\\r\\npulled it out of his pocket for my perusal; and told me that, if I was\\r\\nexpeditious, I might send it into the Board before dinner, for they did\\r\\nno business in the afternoon. He then went with me to coffee-house hard\\r\\nby, where I wrote the letter, which was immediately delivered to the\\r\\nmessenger, who told me I might expect an order to-morrow about the same\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving transacted this piece of business, my mind was a good deal\\r\\ncomposed; and as I had met with so much civility from the stranger, I\\r\\ndesired further acquaintance with him, fully resolved, however, not to\\r\\nbe deceived by him so much to my prejudice as I had been by the beau.\\r\\nHe agreed to dine with me at the cookâ\\x80\\x99s shop which I frequented; and on\\r\\nour way thither carried me to â\\x80\\x99Change, where I was in hopes of finding\\r\\nMr. Jackson (for that was the name of the person who had broke his\\r\\nappointment), I sought him there to no purpose, and on our way towards\\r\\nthe other end of the town imparted to my companion his behaviour\\r\\ntowards me; upon which he gave me to understand, that he was no\\r\\nstranger to the name of Bean Jackson (so he was called at the Navy\\r\\nOffice), although he did not know him personally; that he had the\\r\\ncharacter of a good-natured careless fellow, who made no scruple of\\r\\nborrowing from any that would lend; that most people who knew him\\r\\nbelieved he had a good principle at bottom, but his extravagance was\\r\\nsuch, he would probably never have it in his power to manifest the\\r\\nhonesty of his intention. This made me sweat for my five shillings,\\r\\nwhich I nevertheless did not altogether despair of recovering, provided\\r\\nI could find out the debtor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis young man likewise added another circumstance of Squire Jacksonâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhistory, which was, that being destitute of all means to equip himself\\r\\nfor sea, when he received his last warrant, he had been recommended to\\r\\na person who lent him a little money, after he had signed a will\\r\\nentitling that person to lift his wages when they should become due, as\\r\\nalso to inherit his effects in case of his death. That he was still\\r\\nunder the tutorage and direction of that gentleman, who advanced him\\r\\nsmall sums from time to time upon this security, at the rate of fifty\\r\\nper cent. But at present his credit was very low, because his funds\\r\\nwould do little more than pay what he had already received, this\\r\\nmoderate interest included. After the stranger (whose name was\\r\\nThompson) had entertained me with this account of Jackson, he informed\\r\\nme that he himself had passed for third mate of a third-rate, about\\r\\nfour months ago; since which time he had constantly attended at the\\r\\nNavy Office, in hope of a warrant, having been assured from the\\r\\nbeginning, both by a Scotch member, and one of the commissioners to\\r\\nwhom the member recommended him, that he should be put into the first\\r\\nvacancy; notwithstanding which promise, he had the mortification to see\\r\\nsix or seven appointed in the same station almost every weekâ\\x80\\x94that now\\r\\nbeing utterly impoverished, his sole hope consisted in the promise of a\\r\\nfriend lately come to town, to lend him a small matter, for a present\\r\\nto the secretary; without which he was persuaded he might wait a\\r\\nthousand years to no purpose. I conceived a mighty liking for this\\r\\nyoung fellow, which (I believe) proceeded from the similitude of our\\r\\nfortunes. We spent the whole day together; and as he lived at Wapping I\\r\\ndesired him to take a share of my bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day we returned to the Navy Office, where, after being called\\r\\nbefore the Board, and questioned about the place of my nativity and\\r\\neducation, they ordered a letter to be made out for me, which, upon\\r\\npaying half-a-crown to the clerk, I received, and delivered into the\\r\\nhands of the clerk at Surgeonsâ\\x80\\x99 Hall, together with a shilling for his\\r\\ntrouble in registering my name. By this time my whole stock was\\r\\ndiminished to two shillings, and I saw not the least prospect of\\r\\nrelief, even for present subsistence, much less to enable me to pay the\\r\\nfees at Surgeonsâ\\x80\\x99 Hall for my examination, which would come on in a\\r\\nfortnight. In this state of perplexity, I consulted Strap, who assured\\r\\nme he would pawn everything he had in the world, even to his razors,\\r\\nbefore I should want: but this expedient I absolutely rejected, telling\\r\\nhim, I would a thousand times rather list for a soldier, of which I had\\r\\nsome thoughts, than be any longer a burden to him. At the word soldier,\\r\\nhe grew pale as death, and begged on his knees I would think no more of\\r\\nthat scheme. â\\x80\\x9cGod preserve us all in our right wits!â\\x80\\x9d cried he, â\\x80\\x9cwould\\r\\nyou turn soldier, and perhaps be sent abroad against the Spaniards,\\r\\nwhere you must stand and be shot at like a woodcock? Heaven keep cold\\r\\nlead out of my carcase, and let me die in a bed like a Christian, as\\r\\nall my forefathers have done. What signifies all earthly riches and\\r\\nhonour, if one enjoys not content? and, hereafter, there is no respect\\r\\nof persons. Better be a poor honest barber with a good conscience, and\\r\\ntime to repent of my sins upon my death-bed, than be cut off (God bless\\r\\nus!) by a musket-shot, as it were in the very flower of oneâ\\x80\\x99s age, in\\r\\nthe pursuit of riches and fame. What signify riches, my dear friend? do\\r\\nthey not make unto themselves wings and fly away? as the wise man\\r\\nsaith. I could also mention many other sayings in contempt of riches,\\r\\nboth from the Bible and other good books; but I know you are not very\\r\\nfond of those things, I shall only assure you, that if you take on to\\r\\nbe a soldier, I will do the same; and then if we should both be slain,\\r\\nyou will not only have your own blood to answer for, but mine also: and\\r\\nperadventure the lives of all those whom we shall kill in battle.\\r\\nTherefore I pray you, consider whether you will sit down contented with\\r\\nsmall things and share the fruits of my industry in peace, till\\r\\nProvidence shall send better tidings; or, by your despair, plunge both\\r\\nour souls and bodies into everlasting perdition, which God of his\\r\\ninfinite mercy forbid!â\\x80\\x9d I could not help smiling at this harangue,\\r\\nwhich was delivered with great earnestness, the tears standing in his\\r\\neyes all the time, and promised to do nothing of that sort without his\\r\\nconsent and concurrence. He was much comforted with this declaration;\\r\\nand told me in a few days he should receive a weekâ\\x80\\x99s wages, which\\r\\nshould be at my service, but advised me in the meantime to go in quest\\r\\nof Jackson, and recover, if possible, what he had borrowed of me. I\\r\\naccordingly trudged about from one end of the town to the other, for\\r\\nseveral days, without being able to learn anything certain concerning\\r\\nhim: and, one day being extremely hungry, and allured by the steams\\r\\nthat regaled my nostrils from a boiling cellar, I went down with an\\r\\nintention to gratify my appetite with a twopennyworth of beef; when to\\r\\nmy no small surprise found Mr. Jackson sitting at dinner with a\\r\\nfootman. He no sooner perceived me than he got up and shook me by the\\r\\nhands saying, he was glad to see me, for he intended to have called at\\r\\nmy lodgings in the afternoon. I was so well pleased at this rencounter\\r\\nand the apologies he made for not keeping his appointment, that I\\r\\nforgot my resentment, and sat down to dinner, with the happy\\r\\nexpectation of not only recovering my own money before we should part,\\r\\nbut also of reaping the benefit of his promise to lend me wherewithal\\r\\nto pass examination; and this hope my sanguine complexion suggested,\\r\\nthough the account Thompson gave me of him ought to have moderated my\\r\\nexpectation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we had feasted sumptuously, he took his leave of the footman, and\\r\\nadjourned with me to an ale-house hard by, where, after shaking me by\\r\\nthe hand again, he began thus: â\\x80\\x9cI suppose you think me a sad dog, Mr.\\r\\nRandom, and I do confess that appearances are against me. But I dare\\r\\nsay you will forgive me when I tell you, my not coming at the time\\r\\nappointed was owing to a peremptory message I received from a certain\\r\\nlady, whom, harkee! (but this is a great secret) I am to marry very\\r\\nsoon. You think this strange, perhaps, but it is not less true for all\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x94a five thousand pounder, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll assure you, besides expectations.\\r\\nFor my own part, devil take me if I know what any woman can see\\r\\nengaging about meâ\\x80\\x94but a whim, you knowâ\\x80\\x94and then one would not balk\\r\\noneâ\\x80\\x99s good fortune. You saw that footman who dined with usâ\\x80\\x94heâ\\x80\\x99s one of\\r\\nthe honestest fellows that ever wore livery. You must know it was by\\r\\nhis means I was introduced to her, for he made me first acquainted with\\r\\nher woman, who is his mistressâ\\x80\\x94ay, many a crown has he and his\\r\\nsweetheart had of my moneyâ\\x80\\x94but what of that? things are now brought to\\r\\na bearing. I haveâ\\x80\\x94(come a little this way) I have proposed marriage,\\r\\nand the day is fixedâ\\x80\\x94sheâ\\x80\\x99s a charming creature, and writes like an\\r\\nangel! She can repeat all the English tragedies as well as ever a\\r\\nplayer in Drury Lane!-and, indeed, is so fond of plays, that to be near\\r\\nthe stage she has taken lodgings in a court hard by the theatre; but\\r\\nyou shall seeâ\\x80\\x94you shall seeâ\\x80\\x94hereâ\\x80\\x99s the last letter she sent me.â\\x80\\x9d With\\r\\nthese words, he put it into my hand, and I read (to the best of my\\r\\nremembrance) as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dear Kreeterâ\\x80\\x94As you are the animable hopjack of my contemplayshins,\\r\\nyour aydear is infernally skimming before my keymerycal fansee, when\\r\\nMurfy sends his puppies to the heys of slipping mortals; and when Febus\\r\\nshines from his merry dying throne; whereupon I shall canseif old time\\r\\nhas lost his pinners, as also cubit his harrows, until thou enjoy sweet\\r\\npropose in the loafseek harms of thy very faithfool to commend,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nClayrender\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWingar Yard, Drury Lane,\\r\\nJanuary 12th.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I was reading, he seemed to be in an ecstasy, rubbing his hands,\\r\\nand bursting out into fits of laughter; at last he caught hold of my\\r\\nhand, and squeezing it, cried, â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x94a style for you! What do you\\r\\nthink of this billet-doux?â\\x80\\x9d I answered, â\\x80\\x9cIt might be sblime for aught I\\r\\nknew, for it was altogether above my comprehension.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh, ho!â\\x80\\x9d said he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI believe it isâ\\x80\\x94both tender and sublime; sheâ\\x80\\x99s a divine creature! and\\r\\nso doats upon me! Let me seeâ\\x80\\x94what shall I do with this money, when I\\r\\nhave once got it into my hands? In the first place, I shall do for you.\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m a man of few wordsâ\\x80\\x94-but say no more thatâ\\x80\\x99s determined; whether\\r\\nwould you advise me, to purchase some post, by which I may rise in the\\r\\nstate, or lay out my wifeâ\\x80\\x99s fortune in land, and retire to the country\\r\\nat once?â\\x80\\x9d I gave my opinion without hesitation, that he could not do\\r\\nbetter than buy an estate and improve; especially since he had already\\r\\nseen so much of the world. Then I launched out into the praises of a\\r\\ncountry life, as described by the poets whose works I had read. He\\r\\nseemed to relish my advice, but withal told me, that although he had\\r\\nseen a great deal of the world both at land and sea, having cruised\\r\\nthree whole months in the Channel, yet he should not be satisfied until\\r\\nhe had visited France, which he proposed to do before he should settle;\\r\\nand to carry his wife along with him. I had nothing to object to his\\r\\nproposal; and asked how soon he hoped to be happy. â\\x80\\x9cAs to that,â\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nreplied, â\\x80\\x9cnothing obstructs my happiness but the want of a little ready\\r\\ncash; for you must know, my friend in the city has gone out of town for\\r\\na week or two, but I unfortunately missed my pay at Broad Street, by\\r\\nbeing detained too long by the dear charmerâ\\x80\\x94but there will be a recall\\r\\nat Chatham next week, whither the shipâ\\x80\\x99s books are sent, and I have\\r\\ncommissioned a friend in that place to receive the money.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf that be\\r\\nall,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s no great harm in deferring your marriage a few\\r\\ndays.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes, faith, but there is,â\\x80\\x9d said he; â\\x80\\x9cyou donâ\\x80\\x99t know how many\\r\\nrivals I have, who would take all advantages against me. I would not\\r\\nbalk the impatience of her passion for the worldâ\\x80\\x94the least appearance\\r\\nof coldness or indifference would ruin all; and such offers donâ\\x80\\x99t occur\\r\\nevery day.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI acquiesced in this observation, and inquired how he intended to\\r\\nproceed. At this question he rubbed his chin, and said, â\\x80\\x9cWhy, truly, I\\r\\nmust be obliged to some friend or otherâ\\x80\\x94do you know nobody that would\\r\\nlend me a small sum for a day or two?â\\x80\\x9d I assured him, I was such an\\r\\nutter stranger in London, that I did not believe I could borrow a\\r\\nguinea if my life depended upon it. â\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s hardâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhard! I wish I had anything to pawnâ\\x80\\x94upon my soul, you have got\\r\\nexcellent linen (feeling the sleeve of my shirt); how many shirts of\\r\\nthat kind have you got?â\\x80\\x9d I answered, â\\x80\\x9cSix ruffled, and six plain.â\\x80\\x9d At\\r\\nwhich he testified great surprise, and declared that no gentleman ought\\r\\nto have more than four. â\\x80\\x9cHow many dâ\\x80\\x99ye think I have got?â\\x80\\x9d continued he;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut this and another, as I hope to be saved! and I dare say we shall\\r\\nbe able to raise a good sum out of your superfluity: let me seeâ\\x80\\x94let me\\r\\nseeâ\\x80\\x94each of these shirts is worth sixteen shillings at a moderate\\r\\ncomputationâ\\x80\\x94now, suppose we pawn them for half-priceâ\\x80\\x94eight times eight\\r\\nis sixty-four, thatâ\\x80\\x99s three pounds four; that will doâ\\x80\\x94give me your\\r\\nhand.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSoftly, softly, Mr. Jackson,â\\x80\\x9d said I; â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t dispose of my\\r\\nlinen without my consent: first pay me the crown you owe me, and then\\r\\nwe shall talk of other matters.â\\x80\\x9d He protested that he had not above one\\r\\nshilling in his pocket, but that he would pay me out of the first of\\r\\nthe money raised from the shirts. This piece of assurance incensed me\\r\\nso much that I swore I would not part with him until I had received\\r\\nsatisfaction for what I had lent him; and as for the shirts, I would\\r\\nnot pawn one of them to save him from the gallows.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this expression he laughed aloud, and then complained it was very\\r\\nhard that I should refuse him a trifle that would infallibly enable him\\r\\nnot only to make his own fortune but mine also. â\\x80\\x9cYou talk of pawning my\\r\\nshirts,â\\x80\\x9d said I; â\\x80\\x9csuppose you should sell this hanger, Mr. Jackson. I\\r\\nbelieve it would fetch a good round sum.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo, hang it!â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ncanâ\\x80\\x99t appear decently without my hanger, lest it should go.â\\x80\\x9d However,\\r\\nseeing me inflexible with regard to my linen, he at length unbuckled\\r\\nhis hanger, and, showing me the three blue balls, desired me to carry\\r\\nit thither and pawn it for two guineas. This office I would by no means\\r\\nhave performed, had I seen any likelihood of having my money otherwise;\\r\\nbut not willing, out of a piece of false delicacy, to neglect the only\\r\\nopportunity I should perhaps ever have, I ventured into a pawnbrokerâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nshop, where I demanded two guineas on the pledge, in the name of Thomas\\r\\nWilliams. â\\x80\\x9cTwo guineas!â\\x80\\x9d said the pawnbroker, looking at the hanger;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthis piece of goods has been here several times before for thirty\\r\\nshillings: however, since I believe the gentleman to whom it belongs\\r\\nwill redeem it, he shall have what he wants; and accordingly he paid me\\r\\nthe money, which I carried to the house where I had left Jackson; and,\\r\\ncalling for change, counted out to him seven and thirty shillings,\\r\\nreserving the other five for myself.â\\x80\\x9d After looking at the money some\\r\\ntime, he said, â\\x80\\x9cWell! it donâ\\x80\\x99t signifyâ\\x80\\x94this wonâ\\x80\\x99t do my business; so\\r\\nyou may as well take half-a-guinea, or a whole one, as the five\\r\\nshillings you have kept.â\\x80\\x9d I thanked him kindly, but refused to accept\\r\\nof any more than was my due, because I had no prospect of repaying it.\\r\\nUpon which declaration, he stared in my face, and told me, I was\\r\\nexcessively raw or I would not talk in that manner. â\\x80\\x9cUpon my word,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncried he, â\\x80\\x9cI have a very bad opinion of a young fellow who wonâ\\x80\\x99t borrow\\r\\nof his friend when he is in wantâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99tis the sign of a sneaking spirit.\\r\\nCome, come, Random, give me back the five shillings, and take this\\r\\nhalf-guinea, and if ever you are able to pay me, I believe you will: if\\r\\nnot, I shall never ask it.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I reflected upon my present necessity, I suffered myself to be\\r\\npersuaded, and after making my acknowledgments to Mr. Jackson, who\\r\\noffered to treat me with a play, I returned to my lodgings with a much\\r\\nbetter opinion of this gentleman than I had in the morning; and at\\r\\nnight imparted my dayâ\\x80\\x99s adventure to Strap, who rejoiced at my good\\r\\nluck, saying, â\\x80\\x9cI told you if he was a Scotchman you was safe enoughâ\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nwho knows but this marriage may make us all. You have heard, I suppose,\\r\\nas how a countryman of ours, a journeyman baker, ran away with a great\\r\\nlady of this town, and now keeps his coach. I say nothing; but\\r\\nyesterday morning as I was shaving a gentleman at his own house, there\\r\\nwas a young lady in the room, and she threw so many sheepâ\\x80\\x99s eyes at a\\r\\ncertain person whom I shall not name, that my heart went knock, knock,\\r\\nknock, like a fulling mill, and my hand sh-sh-shook so much that I\\r\\nsliced a piece of skin off the gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s nose; whereby he uttered a\\r\\ndeadly oath, and was going to horsewhip me, when she prevented him, and\\r\\nmade my peace. Is not a journeyman barber as good as a journeyman\\r\\nbaker? The only difference is, the baker uses flour for the belly, and\\r\\nthe barber rises it for the head: and as the head is a more noble\\r\\nmember than the belly, so is a barber more noble than a bakerâ\\x80\\x94for\\r\\nwhatâ\\x80\\x99s the belly without the head? Besides, I am told, he could neither\\r\\nread nor write; now you know I can do both, and moreover, speak\\r\\nLatinâ\\x80\\x94but I will say no more, for I despise vanityâ\\x80\\x94nothing is more vain\\r\\nthan vanity.â\\x80\\x9d With these words, he pulled out of his pocket a\\r\\nwax-candleâ\\x80\\x99s end, which he applied to his forehead; and upon\\r\\nexamination, I found had combed his own hair over the toupee of his\\r\\nwig, and was, indeed, in his whole dress, become a very smart shaver. I\\r\\ncongratulated him on his prospect with a satirical smile, which he\\r\\nunderstood very well; and, shaking his head, observed, I had very\\r\\nlittle faith, but the truth would come to light in spite of my\\r\\nincredulity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI go to Surgeonsâ\\x80\\x99 Hall, when I meet Mr. Jacksonâ\\x80\\x94am examinedâ\\x80\\x94a fierce\\r\\ndispute arises between two of the examinersâ\\x80\\x94Jackson disguises himself\\r\\nto attract respectâ\\x80\\x94irises himself to attract respectâ\\x80\\x94is detectedâ\\x80\\x94in\\r\\nhazard of being sent to Bridewellâ\\x80\\x94he treats us at a Tavernâ\\x80\\x94carries us\\r\\nto a Night-houseâ\\x80\\x94A troublesome adventure thereâ\\x80\\x94we are committed to the\\r\\nRound-houseâ\\x80\\x94carried before a Justiceâ\\x80\\x94his behaviour\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the assistance of this faithful adherent, who gave me almost all\\r\\nthe money he earned, I preserved my half-guinea entire till the day of\\r\\nexamination, when I went with a quaking heart to Surgeonsâ\\x80\\x99 Hall, in\\r\\norder to undergo that ceremony. Among a crowd of young fellows who\\r\\nwalked in the outward hall, I perceived Mr. Jackson, to whom I\\r\\nimmediately went up; and, inquiring into the state of his love affair,\\r\\nunderstood it was still undetermined, by reason of his friendâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nabsence, and the delay of the recall at Chatham, which put it out of\\r\\nhis power to bring it to a conclusion. I then asked what his business\\r\\nwas in this place; he replied, he was resolved to have two strings to\\r\\nhis bow, that in case the one failed, he might use the other; and, with\\r\\nthis view, he was to pass that night for a higher qualification. At\\r\\nthat instant, a young fellow came out from the place of examination,\\r\\nwith a pale countenance, his lip quivering, and his looks as wild as if\\r\\nhe had seen a ghost. He no sooner appeared, than we all flocked about\\r\\nhim with the utmost eagerness to know what reception he had met with;\\r\\nwhich, after some pause, he described, recounting all the questions\\r\\nthey had asked, with the answers he made. In this manner we obliged no\\r\\nless than twelve to recapitulate, which, now the danger was past, they\\r\\ndid with pleasure, before it fell to my lot: at length the beadle\\r\\ncalled my name, with a voice that made me tremble. However, there was\\r\\nno remedy. I was conducted into a large hall, where I saw about a dozen\\r\\nof grim faces sitting at a long table: one of whom bade me come\\r\\nforward, in such an imperious tone, that I was actually for a minute or\\r\\ntwo bereft of my senses. The first question he put to me was, â\\x80\\x9cWhere\\r\\nwas you born?â\\x80\\x9d To which I answered, â\\x80\\x9cIn Scotland.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIn Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nhe; â\\x80\\x9cI know that very wellâ\\x80\\x94we have scarce any other countrymen to\\r\\nexamine hereâ\\x80\\x94you Scotchmen have overspread us of late as the locusts\\r\\ndid Egypt. I ask you in what part of Scotland was you born?â\\x80\\x9d I named\\r\\nthe place of my nativity, which he had never heard of; he then\\r\\nproceeded to interrogate me about my age, the town where I served my\\r\\ntime, with the term of my apprenticeship; and when I informed him that\\r\\nI served three years only, he fell into a violent passion, swore it was\\r\\na shame and a scandal to send such raw boys into the world as surgeons;\\r\\nthat it was great presumption in me, and an affront upon the English,\\r\\nto pretend sufficient skill in my business, having served so short a\\r\\ntime, when every apprentice in England was bound seven years at least:\\r\\nthat my friends would have done better if they had made me a weaver or\\r\\nshoemaker; but their pride would have me a gentleman, he supposed, at\\r\\nany rate, and their poverty could not afford the necessary education.\\r\\nThis exordium did not at all contribute to the recovery of my spirits;\\r\\nbut on the contrary, reduced me to such a situation that I was scarcely\\r\\nable to stand; which being perceived by a plump gentleman who sat\\r\\nopposite to me with a skull before him, he said, Mr. Snarler was too\\r\\nsevere upon the young man; and, turning towards me, told me I need not\\r\\nbe afraid, for nobody would do me any harm: then, bidding me take time\\r\\nto recollect myself, he examined me, touching the operation of the\\r\\ntrepan, and was very well satisfied with my answers. The next person\\r\\nwho questioned me was a wag, who began by asking if I had ever seen\\r\\namputation performed; and I replying in the affirmative, he shook his\\r\\nhead and said, â\\x80\\x9cWhat! upon a dead subject, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf,â\\x80\\x9d continued\\r\\nhe, â\\x80\\x9cduring an engagement at sea, a man should be brought to you with\\r\\nhis head shot off, how would you behave?â\\x80\\x9d After some hesitation, I\\r\\nowned such a case had never come under my observation, neither did I\\r\\nremember to have seen any method of care proposed for such an accident,\\r\\nin any of the systems of surgery I had perused.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether it was owing to the simplicity of my answer, or the archness of\\r\\nthe question, I know not, but every member at the board deigned to\\r\\nsmile, except Mr. Snarler, who seemed to have very little of the\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98animal risibleâ\\x80\\x99 in his constitution. The facetious member, encouraged\\r\\nby the success of his last joke, went on thus: â\\x80\\x9cSuppose you was called\\r\\nto a patient of a plethoric habit, who has been bruised by a fall, what\\r\\nwould you do?â\\x80\\x9d I answered, â\\x80\\x9cI would bleed him immediately.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid he, â\\x80\\x9cbefore you had tied up his arm?â\\x80\\x9d But this stroke of wit not\\r\\nanswering his expectation, he desired me to advance to the gentleman\\r\\nwho sat next him; and who, with a pert air, asked, what method of cure\\r\\nI would follow in wounds of the intestines. I repeated the method of\\r\\ncare as it is prescribed by the best chirurgical writers, which he\\r\\nheard to an end, and then said with a supercilious smile, â\\x80\\x9cSo you think\\r\\nwith such treatment the patient might recover?â\\x80\\x9d I told him I saw\\r\\nnothing to make me think otherwise. â\\x80\\x9cThat may be,â\\x80\\x9d resumed he; â\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nanswer for your foresight, but did you ever know a case of this kind\\r\\nsucceed?â\\x80\\x9d I acknowledged I did not, and was about to tell him I had\\r\\nnever seen a wounded intestine; but he stopt me, by saying, with some\\r\\nprecipitation, â\\x80\\x9cNor never will! I affirm that all wounds of the\\r\\nintestines, whether great or small, are mortal.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPardon me, brother,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsays the fat gentleman, â\\x80\\x9cthere is very good authorityâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d Here he was\\r\\ninterrupted by the other withâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cSir, excuse me, I despise all\\r\\nauthorityâ\\x80\\x94Nullius in verboâ\\x80\\x94I stand on my own bottom.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut sir, sir,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nreplied his antagonist, â\\x80\\x9cthe reason of the thing showsâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cA fig for\\r\\nreason,â\\x80\\x9d cries this sufficient member; â\\x80\\x9cI laugh at reason; give me\\r\\nocular demonstratio.â\\x80\\x9d The corpulent gentleman began to wax warm, and\\r\\nobserved, that no man acquainted with the anatomy of the parts would\\r\\nadvance such an extravagant assertion. This inuendo enraged the other\\r\\nso much, that he started up, and in a furious tone exclaimed: â\\x80\\x9cWhat,\\r\\nSir! do you question my knowledge in anatomy?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time, all the examiners had espoused the opinion of one or\\r\\nother of the disputants, and raised their voices altogether, when the\\r\\nchairman commanded silence, and ordered me to withdraw. In less than a\\r\\nquarter of an hour, I was called in again, received my qualification\\r\\nscaled up, and was ordered to pay five shillings. I laid down my\\r\\nhalf-guinea upon the table, and stood some time, until one of them bade\\r\\nme begone; to this I replied, â\\x80\\x9cI will when I have got my change:â\\x80\\x9d upon\\r\\nwhich another threw me five shillings and sixpence, saying, I should\\r\\nnot be a true Scotchman if I went away without my change. I was\\r\\nafterwards obliged to give three shillings and sixpence to the beadles,\\r\\nand a shilling to an old woman who swept the hall: this disbursement\\r\\nsank my finances to thirteen-pence halfpenny, with which I was sneaking\\r\\noff, when Jackson, perceiving it, came up to me, and begged I would\\r\\ntarry for him, and he would accompany me to the other end of the town,\\r\\nas soon as his examination should be over. I could not refuse this to a\\r\\nperson that was so much my friend; but I was astonished at the change\\r\\nof his dress which was varied in half-an-hour from what I have already\\r\\ndescribed to a very grotesque fashion. His head was covered with an old\\r\\nsmoke tie-wig that did not boast one crooked hair, and a slouched hat\\r\\nover it, which would have very well become a chimney-sweeper, or a\\r\\ndustman; his neck was adorned with a black crape, the ends of which he\\r\\nhad twisted, and fixed in the button-hole of a shabby greatcoat that\\r\\nwrapped up his whole body; his white silk stockings were converted into\\r\\nblack worsted hose: and his countenance was rendered venerable by\\r\\nwrinkles, and a beard of his own painting. When I expressed my surprise\\r\\nat this metamorphosis, he laughed, and told me it was done by the\\r\\nadvice and assistance of a friend, who lived over the way, and would\\r\\ncertainly produce something very much to his advantage; for it gave him\\r\\nthe appearance of age, which never fails of attracting respect. I\\r\\napplauded his sagacity, and waited with impatience for the effects of\\r\\nit. At length he was called in; but whether the oddness of his\\r\\nappearance excited a curiosity more than small in the board, or his\\r\\nbehaviour was not suitable to his figure, I know not, he was discovered\\r\\nto be an imposter, and put into the hands of the beadle in order to be\\r\\nsent to Bridewell. So that instead of seeing him come out with a\\r\\ncheerful countenance, and a surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s qualification in his hand, I\\r\\nperceived him led through the outer hall as a prisoner; and was very\\r\\nmuch alarmed, and anxious to know the occasion; when he called with a\\r\\nlamentable voice, and a piteous aspect to me, and some others who know\\r\\nhim, â\\x80\\x9cFor Godâ\\x80\\x99s sake, gentlemen bear witness that I am the same\\r\\nindividual John Jackson who served as surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s second mate on board\\r\\nthe Elizabeth, or else I shall go to Bridewell!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would have been impossible for the most austere hermit that ever\\r\\nlived to have refrained from laughing at his appearance and address: we\\r\\ntherefore indulged ourselves a good while at his expense, and\\r\\nafterwards pleaded his cause so effectually with the beadle who was\\r\\ngratified with half-a-crown, that the prisoner was dismissed, and in a\\r\\nfew moments renewed his former gaietyâ\\x80\\x94swearing, since the board had\\r\\nrefused his money, he would spend every shilling before he went to bed,\\r\\nin treating his friends; at the same time inviting us all to favour him\\r\\nwith our company. It was now ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock at night, and, as I had a\\r\\ngreat way to walk through streets that were utterly unknown to me, I\\r\\nwas prevailed on to be of their party, in hopes he would afterwards\\r\\naccompany me to my lodgings, according to his promise. He conducted me\\r\\nto his friendâ\\x80\\x99s house, who kept a tavern over the way where we\\r\\ncontinued drinking punch, until the liquor mounted up to our heads, and\\r\\nmade us all extremely frolicsome. I, in particular, was so much\\r\\nelevated, that nothing would serve me but a wench; at which demand\\r\\nJackson expressed much joy, and assured me I should have my desire.\\r\\nbefore we parted Accordingly, when he had paid the reckoning, we\\r\\nsallied out, roaring and singing; and were conducted by our leader to a\\r\\nplace of nocturnal entertainment, where Mr. Jacksonâ\\x80\\x99s dress attracted\\r\\nthe assiduities of two or three nymphs, who loaded him with caresses,\\r\\nin return for the arrack punch with which he treated them, till at\\r\\nlength sleep began to exert his power over us all, and our conductor\\r\\ncalled â\\x80\\x9cTo pay.â\\x80\\x9d When the bill was brought, which amounted to twelve\\r\\nshillings, he put his hand in his pocket, but might have saved himself\\r\\nthe trouble, for his purse was gone. This accident disconcerted him a\\r\\ngood deal at first; but after some recollection, he seized the two\\r\\nladies who sat by him, one in each hand, and swore if they did not\\r\\nimmediately restore his money he would charge a constable with them.\\r\\nThe good lady at the bar, seeing what passed, whispered something to\\r\\nthe drawer, who went out; and then with great composure, asked what was\\r\\nthe matter? Jackson told her he was robbed, and swore if she refused\\r\\nhim satisfaction, he would have her and her female friends committed to\\r\\nBridewell. â\\x80\\x9cRobbed!â\\x80\\x9d cried she, â\\x80\\x9crobbed in my house! Gentlemen and\\r\\nLadies, I take you all to witness, this person has scandalised my\\r\\nreputation.â\\x80\\x9d At that instant, seeing the constable and watch enter, she\\r\\nproceeded â\\x80\\x9cWhat! you must not only endeavour by your false aspersions\\r\\nto ruin my character, but even commit an assault upon my family! Mr.\\r\\nConstable, I charge you with this uncivil person, who has been guilty\\r\\nof a riot here; I shall take care and bring an action against him for\\r\\ndefamation.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I was reflecting on this melancholy event, which had made me\\r\\nquite sober, one of the ladies, being piqued at some repartee that\\r\\npassed between us, cried, â\\x80\\x9cThey are all concerned!â\\x80\\x9d and desired the\\r\\nconstable to take us all into custody; an arrest which was performed\\r\\ninstantly, to the utter astonishment and despair of us all, except\\r\\nJackson, who having been often in such scrapes, was very little\\r\\nconcerned, and charged the constable, in his turn, with the landlady\\r\\nand her whole bevy; upon which we were carried altogether prisoners to\\r\\nthe round-house, where Jackson after a word of comfort to us, informed\\r\\nthe constable of his being robbed, to which he said he would swear next\\r\\nmorning before the justice. In a little time the constable, calling\\r\\nJackson into another room, spoke to him thus: â\\x80\\x9cI perceive that you and\\r\\nyour company are strangers, and am very sorry for your being involved\\r\\nin such an ugly business. I have known this woman a great while; she\\r\\nhas kept a notorious house in the neighbourhood this many years; and\\r\\nalthough often complained of as a nuisance, still escapes through her\\r\\ninterest with the justices, to whom she and all of her employment pay\\r\\ncontribution quarterly for protection. As she charged me with you\\r\\nfirst, her complaint will have the preference, and she can procure\\r\\nevidence to swear whatsoever she shall please to desire of them; so\\r\\nthat, unless you can make it up before morning, you and your companions\\r\\nmay think yourselves happily quit for a monthâ\\x80\\x99s hard labour in\\r\\nBridewell. Nay, if she should swear a robbery or an assault against\\r\\nyou, you will be committed to Newgate and tried at the next session at\\r\\nthe Old Bailey for your life.â\\x80\\x9d This last piece of information had such\\r\\nan effect upon Jackson, that he agreed to make it up, provided his\\r\\nmoney might be restored. The constable told him, that, instead of\\r\\nretrieving what he had lost, he was pretty certain it would cost him\\r\\nsome more before they could come to any composition. But, however, he\\r\\nhad compassion on him, and would, if he pleased, sound them about a\\r\\nmutual release. The unfortunate beau thanked him for his friendship,\\r\\nand returning to us, acquainted us with the substance of this dialogue;\\r\\nwhile the constable, desiring to speak in private with our adversary,\\r\\ncarried her into the next room, and pleaded, our cause so effectually,\\r\\nthat she condescended to make him umpire: he accordingly proposed an\\r\\narbitration, to which we gave our assent; and he fined each party in\\r\\nthree shillings, to be laid out in a bowl of punch, wherein we drowned\\r\\nall animosities, to the inexpressible joy of my two late acquaintances\\r\\nand me, who had been extremely uneasy ever since Jackson mentioned\\r\\nBridewell and Newgate. By the time we had finished our bowlâ\\x80\\x94to which,\\r\\nby the bye, I had contributed my last shillingâ\\x80\\x94it was morning, and I\\r\\nproposed to move homeward, when the constable gave me to understand, he\\r\\ncould discharge no prisoners but by order of the justice, before whom\\r\\nwe must appear. This renewed my chagrin, and I cursed the hour in which\\r\\nI had yielded to Jacksonâ\\x80\\x99s invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout nine oâ\\x80\\x99clock, we were escorted to the house of a certain justice\\r\\nnot many miles distant from Covent Garden, who no sooner saw the\\r\\nconstable enter with a train of prisoners at his heels, than he saluted\\r\\nhim as follows: â\\x80\\x9cSo Mr. Constable, you are a diligent man. What den of\\r\\nrogues have you been scouring?â\\x80\\x9d Then looking at us, who appeared very\\r\\nmuch dejected, he continued: â\\x80\\x9cAy, ay, thieves. I seeâ\\x80\\x94old offenders; oh,\\r\\nyour humble servant, Mrs. Harridan! I suppose these fellows have been\\r\\ntaken robbing your house. Yes, yes, hereâ\\x80\\x99s an old acquaintance of mine.\\r\\nYou have used expedition,â\\x80\\x9d said he to me, â\\x80\\x9cin returning from\\r\\ntransportation; but we shall save you that trouble for the futureâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nsurgeons will fetch you from your next transportation, at their\\r\\nexpense.â\\x80\\x9d I assured his worship he was mistaken in me, for he had never\\r\\nseen me in his life before. To this declaration he replied, â\\x80\\x9cHow! you\\r\\nimpudent rascal, dare you say so to my face? Do you think I am to be\\r\\nimposed upon by that northern accent, which you have assumed? But it\\r\\nshanâ\\x80\\x99t avail youâ\\x80\\x94you shall find me too far north for you. Here, clerk,\\r\\nwrite this fellowâ\\x80\\x99s mittimus. His name is Patrick Gaghagan.â\\x80\\x9d Here Mr.\\r\\nJackson interposed, and told him I was a Scotchman lately come to town,\\r\\ndescended of a good family, and that my name was Random. The justice\\r\\nlooked upon this assertion as an outrage upon his memory, on which he\\r\\nvalued himself exceedingly; and strutting up to Jackson, with a fierce\\r\\ncountenance, put his hands in his side, and said, â\\x80\\x9cWho are you, sir? Do\\r\\nyou give me the lie? Take notice, gentlemen, hereâ\\x80\\x99s a fellow who\\r\\naffronts me upon the bench but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll lay you fast, sirrah, I willâ\\x80\\x94for\\r\\nnotwithstanding your laced jacket, I believe you are a notorious\\r\\nfelon.â\\x80\\x9d My friend was so much abashed at this menace, which was\\r\\nthundered out with great vociferation, that he changed colour, and\\r\\nremained speechless. This confusion his worship took for a symptom of\\r\\nguilt, and, to complete the discovery, continued his threats, â\\x80\\x9cNow, I\\r\\nam convinced you are a thiefâ\\x80\\x94your face discovers it, you tremble all\\r\\nover, your conscience wonâ\\x80\\x99t lie stillâ\\x80\\x94youâ\\x80\\x99ll be hanged, sirrah,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nraising his voice, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ll be hanged; and happy had it been for the\\r\\nworld, as well as for your own miserable soul, if you had been\\r\\ndetected, and cut off in the beginning of your career. Come hither,\\r\\nclerk, and take this manâ\\x80\\x99s confession.â\\x80\\x9d I was in an agony of\\r\\nconsternation, when the constable, going into another room with his\\r\\nworship, acquainted him with the truth of the story; which having\\r\\nlearned, he returned with a smiling countenance, and, addressing\\r\\nhimself to us all, said it was always his way to terrify young people\\r\\nwhen they came before him, that his threats might make a strong\\r\\nimpression on their minds, and deter them from engaging in scenes of\\r\\nriot and debauchery, which commonly ended before the judge. Thus,\\r\\nhaving cloaked his own want of discernment under the disguise of\\r\\npaternal care, we were dismissed, and I found myself as much lightened\\r\\nas if a mountain had been lifted off my breast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI carry my qualification to the Navy Officeâ\\x80\\x94the nature of itâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nbehaviour of the Secretaryâ\\x80\\x94Strapâ\\x80\\x99s concern for my absenceâ\\x80\\x94a battle\\r\\nbetwixt him a blacksmithâ\\x80\\x94the troublesome consequences of itâ\\x80\\x94his\\r\\nharangue to meâ\\x80\\x94his friend the schoolmaster recommends me to a French\\r\\nApothecary, who entertains me as a journeyman\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI would most willingly have gone home to sleep, but was told by my\\r\\ncompanions, that we must deliver our letters of qualification at the\\r\\nNavy office, before one oâ\\x80\\x99clock. Accordingly, we went thither, and gave\\r\\nthem to the secretary, who opened and read them, and I was mightily\\r\\npleased to find myself qualified for second mate of a third-rate. When\\r\\nhe had stuck them all together on a file, one of our company asked if\\r\\nthere were any vacancies; to which interrogation he answered â\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d Then\\r\\nI ventured to inquire if many ships were to be put in commission soon.\\r\\nAt which question he surveyed me with a look of ineffable contempt;\\r\\nand, pushing us out of his office, locked the door without deigning us\\r\\nanother word. We went down stairs, and conferred together on our\\r\\nexpectations, when I understood that each of them had been recommended\\r\\nto one or other of the commissioners, and each of them promised the\\r\\nfirst vacancy that should fall; but that none of them relied solely\\r\\nupon that interest, without a present to the secretary, with whom some\\r\\nof the commissioners went snacks. For which reason, each of them had\\r\\nprovided a small purse; and I was asked what I proposed to give. This\\r\\nwas a vexatious question to me who (far from being in a capacity to\\r\\ngratify a ravenous secretary) had not wherewithal to purchase a dinner.\\r\\nI therefore answered, I had not yet determined what to give; and\\r\\nsneaked off toward my own lodging, lamenting my fate all the way, and\\r\\ninveighing with much bitterness against the barbarity of my\\r\\ngrandfather, and the sordid avarice of my relations, who left me a prey\\r\\nto contempt and indigence.\\r\\n\\r\\nFull of these disagreeable reflections, I arrived at the house where I\\r\\nlodged, and relieved my landlord from great anxiety on my account; for\\r\\nthis honest man believed I had met with some dismal accident, and that\\r\\nhe never should see me again. Strap, who had come to visit me in the\\r\\nmorning, understanding I had been abroad all night, was almost\\r\\ndistracted, and after having obtained leave of his master, had gone in\\r\\nquest of me, though he was even more ignorant of the town than I. Not\\r\\nbeing willing to inform the landlord of my adventure, I told him I had\\r\\nmet an acquaintance at Surgeonsâ\\x80\\x99 Hall, with whom I spent the evening\\r\\nand night; but being very much infested with bugs, I had not slept\\r\\nmuch, and therefore intended to take a little repose; so saying, I went\\r\\nto bed, and desired to be awakened if Strap should happen to come while\\r\\nI should be asleep. I was accordingly roused by my friend himself, who\\r\\nentered my chamber about three oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the afternoon, and presented\\r\\na figure to my eyes that I could scarce believe real. In short, this\\r\\naffectionate shaver, setting out towards Surgeonsâ\\x80\\x99 Hall, had inquired\\r\\nfor me there to no purpose: from whence he found his way to the Navy\\r\\nOffice, where he could hear no tidings of me, because I was unknown to\\r\\neverybody then present; he afterwards went upon â\\x80\\x99Change, in hopes of\\r\\nseeing me upon the Scotch walk, but without success.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, being almost in despair of finding me, he resolved to ask\\r\\neverybody he met in the street, if perchance anyone could give him\\r\\ninformation about me! and actually put his resolution in practice, in\\r\\nspite of the scoffs, curses, and reproaches with which he was answered;\\r\\nuntil a blacksmithâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x99prentice seeing him stop a porter with a burden\\r\\non his back, and hearing his question, for which he received a hearty\\r\\ncurse, called to him, and asked if the person he inquired after was not\\r\\na Scotchman? Strap replied with great eagerness, â\\x80\\x9cYes, and had on a\\r\\nbrown coat, with long skirts.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe same!â\\x80\\x9d said the blacksmith. â\\x80\\x9cI saw\\r\\nhim pass by an hour ago,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDid you so?â\\x80\\x9d cried Strap, rubbing his hands,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOdd! I am very glad of thatâ\\x80\\x94which way went he?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTowards Tyburn in a\\r\\ncart,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cif you make good speed, you may get thither time\\r\\nenough to see him hanged.â\\x80\\x9d This piece of wit incensed my friend to such\\r\\na degree, that he called the blacksmith scoundrel, and protested he\\r\\nwould fight him for half-a-farthing. â\\x80\\x9cNo, no!â\\x80\\x9d said the other,\\r\\nstripping; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll have none of your moneyâ\\x80\\x94you Scotchmen seldom carry\\r\\nanything about you; but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll fight you for love.â\\x80\\x9d There was a ring\\r\\nimmediately formed by the mob: and Strap, finding he could not get off\\r\\nhonourably without fighting, at the same time burning with resentment\\r\\nagainst his adversary, quitted his clothes to the care of the\\r\\nmultitude, and the battle began with great violence on the side of\\r\\nStrap, who in a few minutes exhausted his breath and spirits on his\\r\\npatient antagonist, who sustained the assault with great coolness, till\\r\\nfinding the barber quite spent, he returned the blows he had lent him,\\r\\nwith such interest, that Strap, after having received three falls on\\r\\nthe hard stones, gave out, and allowed the blacksmith to be the better\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe victory being thus decided, it was proposed to adjourn to a cellar\\r\\nhard by, and drink friends. But when my friend began to gather up his\\r\\nclothes, he perceived that some honest person or other had made free\\r\\nwith his shirt, neckcloth, hat, and wig, which were carried off; and\\r\\nprobably his coat and waistcoat would have met with the same fate, had\\r\\nthey been worth stealing. It was in vain for him to make a noise, which\\r\\nonly yielded mirth to the spectators; he was fain to get off in this\\r\\nmanner, which he accomplished with much difficulty and appeared before\\r\\nme all besmeared with blood and dirt. Notwithstanding this misfortune,\\r\\nsuch was his transport at finding me safe and sound, that he had almost\\r\\nstifled and stunk me to death with his embraces. After he had cleaned\\r\\nhimself, and put on one of my shirts, and a woollen nightcap, I\\r\\nrecounted to him the particulars of my nightâ\\x80\\x99s campaign, which filled\\r\\nhim with admiration, and made him repeat with great energy an\\r\\nobservation which was often in his mouth, namely, â\\x80\\x98that surely London\\r\\nis the devilâ\\x80\\x99s drawing-room.â\\x80\\x99 As neither of us had dined, he desired me\\r\\nto get up, and the milkwoman coming round at that instant, he went\\r\\ndownstairs, and brought up a quart, with a penny loaf, on which we made\\r\\na comfortable meal. He then shared his money with me, which amounted to\\r\\neighteen-pence, and left me with an intention to borrow an old wig and\\r\\nhat of his friend the schoolmaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was no sooner gone, than I began to consider my situation with great\\r\\nuneasiness, and revolved all the schemes my imagination could suggest,\\r\\nin order to choose and pursue some one that would procure me bread; for\\r\\nit is impossible to express the pangs I felt, when I reflected on the\\r\\nmiserable dependence in which I lived at the expense of a poor barberâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nboy. My pride took the alarm, and having no hopes of succeeding at the\\r\\nNavy Office, I came to a resolution of enlisting in the foot-guards\\r\\nnext day, be the event what it would. This extravagant design, by\\r\\nflattering my disposition, gave great satisfaction; and I was charging\\r\\nthe enemy at the head of my own regiment, when Strapâ\\x80\\x99s return\\r\\ninterrupted my reverie. The schoolmaster had made him a present of the\\r\\ntie-wig which he wore, when I was introduced to him, together with an\\r\\nold hat, whose brims would have overshadowed a Colossus. Though Strap\\r\\nhad ventured to wear them in the dusk, he did not choose to entertain\\r\\nthe mob by day; therefore went to work immediately, and reduced them\\r\\nboth to a moderate size. While he was employed in this office, he\\r\\naddressed me thus: â\\x80\\x9cTo be sure, Mr. Random, you are born a gentleman,\\r\\nand have a great deal of learningâ\\x80\\x94and, indeed, look like a gentleman;\\r\\nfor, as to person, you may hold up your head with the best of them. On\\r\\nthe other hand, I am a poor but honest cobblerâ\\x80\\x99s son: my mother was as\\r\\nindustrious a woman as ever broke bread, till such time as she took to\\r\\ndrinking, which you very well know; but everybody has failingsâ\\x80\\x94Humanum\\r\\nest errare. Now myself, I am a poor journeyman barber, tolerably well\\r\\nmade and understand some Latin, and have a smattering of Greek; but\\r\\nwhat of that? Perhaps I might also say, that I know a little of the\\r\\nworld; but that is to no purpose,â\\x80\\x94though you be gentle, and I simple,\\r\\nit does not follow, but that I who am simple may do a good office to\\r\\nyou who are gentle. Now this is the case: my kinsman, the\\r\\nschoolmasterâ\\x80\\x94perhaps you did not know how nearly he is related to\\r\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ll satisfy you in that presently; his mother and my grandmotherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsisterâ\\x80\\x99s nephewâ\\x80\\x94no, thatâ\\x80\\x99s not it!â\\x80\\x94my grandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s brotherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndaughterâ\\x80\\x94rabbit it! I have forgot the degree. But this I know, he and I\\r\\nare cousins seven times removed.â\\x80\\x9d My impatience to know the good office\\r\\nhe had done me, got the better of my temper, and I interrupted him at\\r\\nthis place with the exclamation, â\\x80\\x9cIf the schoolmaster or you can be of\\r\\nany advantage to me, why donâ\\x80\\x99t you tell me without all this preamble?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nWhen I pronounced these words with some vehemence, Strap looked at me\\r\\nfor same time with a grave countenance, and then went on: â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m very\\r\\nsorry to see such an alteration in your temper of late; you were always\\r\\nfiery, but now you are grown as crabbed as old Periwinkle the drunken\\r\\ntinker, on whom you and I (God forgive us!) played so many unlucky\\r\\ntricks while we were at schoolâ\\x80\\x94but I will no longer detain you in\\r\\nsuspense, because (doubtless) nothing is more uneasy than doubtâ\\x80\\x94Dubio\\r\\nprocul dubio nil dubius. My friend or relation, or which you will, or\\r\\nboth, the schoolmaster, being informed of the regard I have for you;\\r\\nfor you may be sure I did not fail to let him know of your good\\r\\nqualitiesâ\\x80\\x94by the bye, he has undertaken to teach you the pronunciation\\r\\nof the English tongue, without which, he says, you will be unfit for\\r\\nbusiness in this countryâ\\x80\\x94I say my relation has spoke in your behalf to\\r\\na French apothecary who wants a journeyman; and on his recommendation\\r\\nyou may have fifteen pounds a year, bed and board, whenever you\\r\\nplease.â\\x80\\x9d I was too much interested in this piece of news to entertain\\r\\nit with indifference; but, jumping up, insisted on Strapâ\\x80\\x99s immediately\\r\\naccompanying me to the house of his friend, that I might not lose this\\r\\nopportunity through the least delay or neglect on my part.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were informed, that the schoolmaster was in company at a publichouse\\r\\nin the neighbourhood, whither we repaired, and found him drinking with\\r\\nthe very individual apothecary in question. When he was called to the\\r\\ndoor at our desire, and observed my impatience, he broke out into his\\r\\nusual term of admiration. â\\x80\\x9cOh! I suppose, when you heard of this offer,\\r\\nyou did not take leisure enough to come downstairs, but leaped out of\\r\\nthe window: did you overturn no porter nor oyster-woman in your way? It\\r\\nwas a mercy of God you did not knock your brains out against some post\\r\\nin your career. Oh, my conscience! I believe, had I been in the inmost\\r\\nrecesses of my habitationâ\\x80\\x94the very penetraliaâ\\x80\\x94your eagerness would have\\r\\nsurmounted bolts, bars, decency, and everything. The den of Cacus, or\\r\\nsanctum sanctorum, could not have hid me from you. But come along the\\r\\ngentleman of whom I spoke is in the house; I will present you to him\\r\\nforthwith.â\\x80\\x9d When I entered the room, I perceived four or five people\\r\\nsmoking, one of whom the schoolmaster accosted thus: â\\x80\\x9cMr. Lavement,\\r\\nhereâ\\x80\\x99s the young man of whom I spoke to you.â\\x80\\x9d The apothecary, who was a\\r\\nlittle old withered man, with a forehead about an inch high, a nose\\r\\nturned up at the end, large cheek-bones that helped to form a pit for\\r\\nhis little gray eyes, a great bag of loose skin hanging down on each\\r\\nside in wrinkles, like the alforjos of a baboon, and a mouth so much\\r\\naccustomed to that contraction which produces grinning, that he could\\r\\nnot pronounce a syllable without discovering the remains of his teeth,\\r\\nwhich consisted of four yellow fangs, not improperly, by anatomists,\\r\\ncalled canine. This person, I say, after having eyed me some time,\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x9cOho, â\\x80\\x99tis ver well, Monsieur Concordance; young man, you are ver\\r\\nwelcome, take one coup of bierreâ\\x80\\x94and come to mine house to-morrow\\r\\nmorning; Monsieur Concordance vil show you de way.â\\x80\\x9d Upon this I made my\\r\\nbow, and as I went out of the room could hear him say, â\\x80\\x9cMa foi! câ\\x80\\x99est\\r\\nun beau garÃ§on; câ\\x80\\x99est un gaillard.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I had by my own application, while I served Crab, acquired the\\r\\nFrench tongue well enough to read authors written in that language and\\r\\nunderstand anything that occurred in conversation, I determined to\\r\\npretend ignorance to my new master, that he and his family, whom I\\r\\nsupposed to be of the same country, not being on the reserve before me,\\r\\nI might possibly discover something in discourse, which would either\\r\\nyield me amusement or advantage. Next morning Mr. Concordance carried\\r\\nme to the apothecaryâ\\x80\\x99s house, where the bargain was made, and orders\\r\\ngiven to provide an apartment for me immediately. But before I entered\\r\\nupon business the schoolmaster recommended me to his tailor, who gave\\r\\nme credit for a suit of clothes, to be paid out of the first moiety of\\r\\nmy wages, and they were begun upon that very day; he afterwards\\r\\naccommodated me with a new hat on the same term: so that in a few days\\r\\nI hoped to make a very fashionable appearance. In the meantime, Strap\\r\\nconveyed my baggage to the place allotted for me, which was a back room\\r\\nup two pair of stairs, furnished with a pallet for me to lie upon, a\\r\\nchair without a back, a bottle by way of candlestick, and a triangular\\r\\npiece of glass instead of a mirror; the rest of its ornaments having\\r\\nbeen lately removed to one of the garrets, for the convenience of the\\r\\nservant of an Irish captain, who lodged in the first floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character of Mr. Lavement, his wife and daughterâ\\x80\\x94some anecdotes of\\r\\nthe familyâ\\x80\\x94the mother and daughter rivalsâ\\x80\\x94I am guilty of a mistake that\\r\\ngives me present satisfaction, but is attended with troublesome\\r\\nconsequences\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day, while I was at work in the shop, a bouncing damsel well\\r\\ndressed came on pretence of finding a vial for some use or other; and\\r\\ntaking an opportunity, when she thought I did not mind her, of\\r\\nobserving me narrowly, went away with a silent look of disdain. I\\r\\neasily guessed her sentiments, and my pride took the resolution of\\r\\nentertaining the same indifference and neglect towards her. At dinner\\r\\nthe maids, with whom I dined in the kitchen, gave me to understand that\\r\\nthis was my masterâ\\x80\\x99s only daughter, who would have a very handsome\\r\\nfortune, on account of which, and her beauty, a great many young\\r\\ngentlemen made their addresses to herâ\\x80\\x94that she had been twice on the\\r\\nbrink of marriage, but disappointed by the stinginess of her father,\\r\\nwho refused to part with a shilling to promote the match; for which\\r\\nreason the young lady did not behave to her father with all the filial\\r\\nveneration that might be expected. In particular she harboured the most\\r\\nperfect hatred for his countrymen; in which disposition she resembled\\r\\nher mother, who was an English-woman; and, by the hints they dropped, I\\r\\nlearned the gray mare was the better horseâ\\x80\\x94that she was a matron of a\\r\\nhigh spirit, which was often manifested at the expense of her\\r\\ndependents; that she loved diversions, and looked upon miss as her\\r\\nrival in all partiesâ\\x80\\x94which was indeed the true cause of her\\r\\ndisappointments; for had the mother been hearty in her interest, the\\r\\nfather would not have ventured to refuse her demands. Over and above\\r\\nthis intelligence, I, of myself, soon made more discoveries. Mr.\\r\\nLavementâ\\x80\\x99s significant grins at his wife, while she looked another way,\\r\\nconvinced me that he was not at all content with his lot; and his\\r\\nbehaviour in presence of the captain made me believe his chief torment\\r\\nwas jealousy. As for my own part, I was considered in no other light\\r\\nthan that of a menial servant, and had been already six days in the\\r\\nhouse without being honoured with one word from either mother or\\r\\ndaughter; the latter (as I understood from the maids) having at table\\r\\none day expressed some surprise that her papa should entertain such an\\r\\nawkward mean-looking journeyman. I was nettled at this piece of\\r\\ninformation, and next Sunday (it being my turn to take my diversion)\\r\\ndressed myself in my new clothes to the greatest advantage, and, vanity\\r\\napart, made no contemptible figure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having spent most part of the day in company with Strap and some\\r\\nof his acquaintance, I came home in the afternoon, and was let in by\\r\\nmiss, who not knowing me, dropped a low curtsey as I advanced, which I\\r\\nreturned with a profound bow, and shut the door. By the time I had\\r\\nturned about, she had perceived her mistake, and changed colour, but\\r\\ndid not withdraw. The passage being narrow, I could not get away\\r\\nwithout jolting her; so I was forced to remain where I was with my eyes\\r\\nfixed to the ground, and my face glowing with blushes. At length, her\\r\\nvanity coming to her assistance, she went away tittering, and I could\\r\\nhear her pronounce the word â\\x80\\x98creature!â\\x80\\x99 From this day forward, she came\\r\\ninto the shop fifty times, every day upon various pretences, and put in\\r\\npractice so many ridiculous airs, that I could easily perceive her\\r\\nopinion of me was changed, and that she did not think me altogether an\\r\\nunworthy conquest. But my heart was so steeled against her charms by\\r\\npride and resentment, which were two chief ingredients in my\\r\\ndisposition, that I remained insensible to all her arts; and\\r\\nnotwithstanding some advances she made, could not be prevailed upon to\\r\\nyield her the least attention. This neglect soon banished all the\\r\\nfavourable impressions she felt for me, and the rage of a slighted\\r\\nwoman took place in her heart; this she manifested not only in all the\\r\\nsuggestions her malice could invent to my prejudice with her father,\\r\\nbut also in procuring for me such servile employments as she hoped\\r\\nwould sufficiently humble my spirit. One day in particular, she ordered\\r\\nme to brush my masterâ\\x80\\x99s coat; but I refusing, a smart dialogue ensued,\\r\\nwhich ended in her bursting into tears of rage; when her mother\\r\\ninterposing, and examining into the merits of the cause, determined it\\r\\nin my favour: and this good office I owed not to any esteem or\\r\\nconsideration she had for me, but solely to the desire of mortifying\\r\\nher daughter, who on this occasion observed, that let people be never\\r\\nso much in the right, there were some folks who would never do them\\r\\njustice, but, to be sure, they had their reasons for it, which some\\r\\npeople were ignorant of, although they despised their little arts. This\\r\\ninsinuation of some people and some folks put me upon observing the\\r\\nbehaviour of my mistress more narrowly for the future: and it was not\\r\\nlong before I had reason to believe that she looked upon her daughter\\r\\nas a rival in the affections of Captain Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell, who lodged in the\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, my industry and knowledge gained me the goodwill of my\\r\\nmaster, who would often say in French, â\\x80\\x9cMardy! câ\\x80\\x99est un bon garÃ§on.â\\x80\\x9d He\\r\\nhad a great deal of business; but he was mostly employed among his\\r\\nfellow refugees, his profits were small. However, his expense for\\r\\nmedicines was not great; for he was the most expert man at a\\r\\nsuccedaneum of any apothecary in London, so that I have been sometimes\\r\\namazed to see him, without the least hesitation, make up a physicianâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nprescription, though he had not in his shop one medicine mentioned in\\r\\nit. Oyster-shells he could convert into crabâ\\x80\\x99s eyes; common oil into\\r\\noil of sweet almonds; syrup of sugar into balsamic syrup; Thames water\\r\\ninto aqua cinnamoni; and a hundred more costly preparations were\\r\\nproduced in an instant, from the cheapest and coarsest drugs of the\\r\\nmateria medica: and when any common thing was ordered for a patient, he\\r\\nalways took care to disguise it in colour or taste, or both, in such a\\r\\nmanner that it could not possibly be known; for which purpose cochineal\\r\\nand oil of cloves were of great service. Mr. Lavement had attempted\\r\\nmore than once to introduce a vegetable diet into his family, by\\r\\nlaunching out into the praise of roots and greens, and decrying the use\\r\\nof flesh, both as a physician and philosopher; but all his rhetoric\\r\\ncould not make one proselyte to his opinion, and even the wife of his\\r\\nbosom declared against the proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne afternoon, when her husband was abroad, and his daughter gone to\\r\\nvisit, this lady ordered me to call a hackney-coach, in which she and\\r\\nthe captain drove towards Covent Garden. Miss came home in the evening,\\r\\nand, supping at her usual hour, went to bed. About eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock my\\r\\nmaster entered, and asked if his wife was gone to sleep: upon which I\\r\\ntold him, my mistress went out in the afternoon, and was not yet\\r\\nreturned. This was like a clap of thunder to the poor apothecary, who\\r\\nstarting back, cried, â\\x80\\x9cMort de ma vie! vat you tell a me? My vife not\\r\\nat home!â\\x80\\x9d At that instant a patientâ\\x80\\x99s servant arrived with a\\r\\nprescription for a draught, which my master taking, went into the shop\\r\\nto make it up with his own hand. While he rubbed the ingredients in a\\r\\nglass mortar, he inquired of me, whether or no his wife went out alone;\\r\\nand no sooner heard that she was in company with the captain, than with\\r\\none blow he split the mortar into a thousand pieces, and grinning like\\r\\nthe head of a bass viol, exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cAh, traitresse!â\\x80\\x9d It would have\\r\\nbeen impossible for me to have preserved my gravity a minute longer,\\r\\nwhen I was happily relieved by a rap at the door, which I opened, and\\r\\nperceived my mistress coming out of the coach. She flounced immediately\\r\\ninto the shop, and addressed her husband thus: â\\x80\\x9cI suppose you thought I\\r\\nwas lost, my dear. Captain Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell has been so good as to treat me\\r\\nwith a play.â\\x80\\x9d The reply, it may be supposed, was anything but courteous\\r\\nbut the captain, who had been all the time at the door discharging the\\r\\ncoach, entered, and Mr. Lavement, changing his tone, saluted him with\\r\\nall the usual politesse of a Frenchman.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after this event, by the knowledge which I acquired of the\\r\\nfamily secrets, my life became much more agreeable; and as I every day\\r\\nimproved in my knowledge of the town I shook off my awkward air by\\r\\ndegrees, and acquired the character of a polite journeyman apothecary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI am assaulted and dangerously woundedâ\\x80\\x94suspect Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell, and am\\r\\nconfirmed in my opinionâ\\x80\\x94concert a scheme of revenge, and put it into\\r\\nexecutionâ\\x80\\x94Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell robs his own servant and disappearsâ\\x80\\x94make my\\r\\naddresses to a lady, and am miraculously delivered from her snare\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night, at about twelve oâ\\x80\\x99clock, as I returned from visiting a\\r\\npatient at Chelsea, I received a blow on my head from an unseen hand,\\r\\nthat stretched me senseless on the ground; and was left for dead with\\r\\nthree stabs of a sword in my body. The groans I uttered when I\\r\\nrecovered the use of my reason alarmed the people of a solitary\\r\\nalehouse that stood near the spot where I lay: and they were humane\\r\\nenough to take me in, and send for a surgeon, who dressed my wounds,\\r\\nand assured me they were not mortal. One of them penetrated through the\\r\\nskin and muscles of one side of my belly in such a manner, that\\r\\ndoubtless the assassin imagined he had run me through the entrails. The\\r\\nsecond slanted along one of my ribs; and the last, which was intended\\r\\nfor the finishing stroke, having been directed to my heart, the sword\\r\\nsnapped upon my breast-bone, and the point remained sticking in the\\r\\nskin. When I reflected upon this event, I could not persuade myself\\r\\nthat I had been assaulted by a common footpad, because it is not usual\\r\\nfor such people to murder though they rob, especially when they meet\\r\\nwith no resistance; and I found my money, and everything else about me\\r\\nbut my carcase, safe. I concluded, therefore, that I must either have\\r\\nbeen mistaken for another, or obliged to the private resentment of some\\r\\nsecret enemy for what had happened; and as I could remember nobody who\\r\\nhad the least cause of complaint against me, except Captain Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell\\r\\nand my masterâ\\x80\\x99s daughter, my suspicion settled upon them, though I took\\r\\ncare to conceal it, that I might the sooner arrive at confirmation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this view, I went home in the chair about ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the\\r\\nmorning; and as the chairman supported me into the house, met the\\r\\ncaptain in the passage, who no sooner saw me than he started back and\\r\\ngave evident signs of guilty confusion, which he would have accounted\\r\\nfor from surprise occasioned by the seeing me in such a condition. My\\r\\nmaster having heard my story, condoled me with a good deal of sympathy,\\r\\nand when he understood my wounds were not dangerous, ordered me to be\\r\\ncarried upstairs to bed; though not without some opposition from his\\r\\nwife, who was of opinion that it would be better for me to go to an\\r\\nhospital, where I should be more carefully attended. My meditation was\\r\\nemployed in concerting with myself some method of revenge against\\r\\nSquire Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell and his inamorata, whom I looked upon as the author of\\r\\nmy misfortune; when miss, who was not at home at my arrival, entered my\\r\\nchamber, and saying she was sorry for the accident that had befallen\\r\\nme, asked if I suspected anybody to be the assassin; upon which I fixed\\r\\nmy eyes steadfastly upon her and answered, â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d She discovered no\\r\\nsymptom of confusion, but replied hastily, â\\x80\\x9cIf that be the case, why\\r\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t you take out a warrant, to have him apprehended? It will cost but\\r\\na trifleâ\\x80\\x94if you have no money, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll lend you.â\\x80\\x9d This frankness not only\\r\\ncured me of my suspicion with respect to her, but even staggered my\\r\\nbelief with regard to the captain, of whose guilt I resolved to have\\r\\nfurther proof before I should enterprise anything in the way of\\r\\nrevenge. I thanked her kindly for her generous offer, which, however, I\\r\\nhad no occasion to accept, being determined to do nothing rashly: for\\r\\nthough I could plainly perceive the person who attacked me to be a\\r\\nsoldier, whose face I thought was familiar to me, I could not swear\\r\\nwith a safe conscience to any particular man; and, granting I could, my\\r\\nprosecution of him would not much avail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis uncertainty I pretended, lest the captain, hearing from her that I\\r\\nknew the person who wounded me, might think proper to withdraw before I\\r\\ncould be in a condition to requite him. In two days I was up and able\\r\\nto do a little business, so that Mr. Lavement made shift to carry on\\r\\nhis practice without hiring another journeyman in my room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thing I attempted towards a certain discovery of my secret\\r\\nenemy, was to get into Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnellâ\\x80\\x99s apartment, while he was abroad in an\\r\\nundress, and examine his sword, the point of which being broken off, I\\r\\napplied the fragment that was found sticking in my body, and found it\\r\\nanswered the fractured part exactly. There was no room left for doubt;\\r\\nand all that remained was to fix upon a scheme of revenge, which almost\\r\\nsolely engrossed my thoughts during the space of eight nights and days.\\r\\nSometimes I was tempted to fall upon him in the same manner as he had\\r\\npractised upon me, and kill him outright. But this assault my honour\\r\\nopposed as a piece of barbarous cowardice, in which he was not to be\\r\\nimitated. At other times I entertained thoughts of demanding\\r\\nsatisfaction in an honourable way; but was diverted from this\\r\\nundertaking by considering the uncertainty of the event, and the nature\\r\\nof the injury he had done me, which did not entitle him to such easy\\r\\nterms. At last I determined to pursue a middle course, and actually put\\r\\nmy design in execution after this manner. Having secured the assistance\\r\\nof Strap and two of his acquaintance whom he could depend upon, we\\r\\nprovided ourselves with disguises, and I caused the following letter to\\r\\nbe delivered to him by one of our associates in livery, one Sunday\\r\\nevening:â\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSirâ\\x80\\x94If I may be allowed to judge from appearance, it will not be\\r\\ndisagreeable for you to hear that my husband is gone to Bagshot to\\r\\nvisit a patient, and will not return till to-morrow night; so that, if\\r\\nyou have anything to propose to me (as your behaviour on many occasions\\r\\nhas seemed to insinuate), you will do well to embrace the present\\r\\nopportunity of seeing,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYours, etc.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter was signed with the name of an apothecaryâ\\x80\\x99s wife who lived\\r\\nin Chelsea, of whom I had heard Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell was an admirer. Everything\\r\\nsucceeded to our wish. The hero hastened towards the place of\\r\\nappointment, and was encountered by us in the very place where he had\\r\\nassaulted me. We rushed upon him all at once, secured his sword,\\r\\nstripped off his clothes even to the skin, which was scourged with\\r\\nnettles till he was blistered from head to foot, notwithstanding all\\r\\nthe eloquence of his tears and supplications. When I was satisfied with\\r\\nthe stripes I had bestowed, we carried off his clothes, which we hid in\\r\\na hedge near the place, and left him stark naked to find his way home\\r\\nin the best manner he could, while I took care to be there before him.\\r\\nI afterwards understood that, in his way to the lodgings of a friend,\\r\\nwho lived in the skirts of the town, he was picked up by the watch, who\\r\\ncarried him to the round-house, from whence he sent for clothes to his\\r\\nlodgings, and next morning arrived at the door in a chair, wrapt up in\\r\\na blanket he had borrowed; for his body was so sore and swelled, that\\r\\nhe could not bear to be confined in his wearing apparel. He was treated\\r\\nwith the utmost tenderness by my mistress and her daughter, who vied\\r\\nwith each other in their care and attendance of him; but Lavement\\r\\nhimself could not forbear expressing his joy, by several malicious\\r\\ngrins, while he ordered me to prepare an unguent for his sores. As to\\r\\nmyself, nobody can doubt my gratification, when I had every day an\\r\\nopportunity of seeing my revenge protracted on the body of my\\r\\nadversary, by the ulcers of which I had been the cause; and, indeed, I\\r\\nnot only enjoyed the satisfaction of having fleaâ\\x80\\x99d him alive, but\\r\\nanother also which I had not foreseen. The story of his being attacked\\r\\nand stripped in such a place having been inserted in the news, gave\\r\\ninformation to those who found his clothes next day, whither to bring\\r\\nthem; and accordingly he retrieved everything he had lost except a few\\r\\nletters, among which was that which I had writ to him in the name of\\r\\nthe apothecaryâ\\x80\\x99s wife. This, and the others, which were all on the\\r\\nsubject of love (for this Hibernian hero was one of those people who\\r\\nare called fortune-hunters), fell into the hands of a certain female\\r\\nauthor, famous for the scandal she has published; who, after having\\r\\nembellished them with some ornaments of her own invention, gave them to\\r\\nthe to town in print. I was very much shocked on reflection, that I\\r\\nmight possibly be the occasion of a whole familyâ\\x80\\x99s unhappiness on\\r\\naccount of the letter I had written; but was eased of that\\r\\napprehension, when I understood that the Chelsea apothecary had\\r\\ncommenced a lawsuit against the printer for defamation, and looked upon\\r\\nthe whole as a piece of forgery committed by the author, who had\\r\\ndisappeared. But whatever might be his opinion of the matter, our two\\r\\nladies seemed to entertain a different idea of it: for as soon as the\\r\\npamphlet appeared, I could perceive their care of their patient\\r\\nconsiderably diminish, till at last it ended in a total neglect. It was\\r\\nimpossible for him to be ignorant of this change, any more than of the\\r\\noccasion of it; but as he was conscious to himself of having deserved\\r\\nworse than contempt at their hands, he was glad to come off so cheaply,\\r\\nand contented himself with muttering curses and threats against the\\r\\napothecary, who, as he imagined, having got an inkling of the\\r\\nappointment with his wife, had taken revenge of him in the manner\\r\\ndescribed. By the time he had got a new scarf skin his character was\\r\\nbecome so notorious, that he thought it high time for him to decamp;\\r\\nand his retreat he performed in one night, without beat of drum, after\\r\\nhaving robbed his own servant of everything that belonged to him except\\r\\nthe clothes he had on his back.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days after he disappeared, Mr. Lavement, for his own security,\\r\\ntook into his custody a large old trunk which he had left; and as it\\r\\nwas very heavy, made no question that the contents were sufficient to\\r\\nindemnify him for what Oâ\\x80\\x99Donnell owed in lodging. But a month being\\r\\nelapsed without hearing any tidings of this adventurer, and my master\\r\\nbeing impatient to know what the trunk contained, he ordered me to\\r\\nbreak it open in his presence, which task I performed with the pestle\\r\\nof our great mortar, and discovered, to his inexpressible astonishment\\r\\nand mortification, a heap of stones.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout this time, my friend Strap informed me of an offer he had to go\\r\\nabroad with a gentleman in quality of valet de chambre and at the same\\r\\ntime assured me that, whatever advantage he might propose to himself\\r\\nfrom this prospect, he could not bear the thoughts of parting from me,\\r\\nso much was he attached to my fortune. In spite of all the obligations\\r\\nI owed to this poor, honest fellow, ingratitude is so natural to the\\r\\nheart of man, that I began to be tired of his acquaintance: and now\\r\\nthat I had contracted other friendships which appeared more creditable,\\r\\nwas even ashamed to see a journeyman barber inquiring after me with the\\r\\nfamiliarity of a companion. I therefore, on pretence of consulting his\\r\\nwelfare, insisted upon his accepting the proposal, which he at last\\r\\ndetermined to embrace, with great reluctance, and in a few days, took\\r\\nhis leave of me, shedding a flood of tears, which I could not behold\\r\\nwithout emotion. I now began to look upon me as of a gentleman in\\r\\nreality; learned to dance, frequented plays during the holidays; became\\r\\nthe oracle of an ale-house, where every dispute was referred to my\\r\\ndecision; and at length contracted an acquaintance with a young lady,\\r\\nwho found means to make a conquest of my heart, and upon whom I\\r\\nprevailed, after much attendance and solicitation, to give me a promise\\r\\nof marriage. As this beautiful creature passed for a rich heiress, I\\r\\nblessed my good fortune, and was actually on the point of crowning all\\r\\nmy wishes by matrimony, when I made such a discovery as effectually\\r\\nturned me from my design, and I abandoned all thoughts of marriage for\\r\\nthe future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSquire Gawky comes to lodge with my masterâ\\x80\\x94is involved in a troublesome\\r\\naffair, out of which he is extricated by meâ\\x80\\x94he marries my masterâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndaughterâ\\x80\\x94they conspire against meâ\\x80\\x94I am found guilty of theft,\\r\\ndischargedâ\\x80\\x94deserted by my friends, I hire a room in St. Gileâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\x80\\x94where,\\r\\nby accident, I find the lady to whom I paid my addresses in a miserable\\r\\nconditionâ\\x80\\x94I relieve her\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I enjoyed myself at large in this temper of mind, Lavement let his\\r\\nfirst floor to my countryman and acquaintance, Squire Gawky, who by\\r\\nthis time had got a lieutenancy in the army, and such a martial\\r\\nferocity in his appearance that I was afraid he would remember what\\r\\nhappened between us in Scotland, and atone for his breach of\\r\\nappointment then by his punctuality now; but whether he had actually\\r\\nforgot me, or was willing to make me believe so, he betrayed not the\\r\\nleast symptom of recognition at sight of me, and I remained quite cured\\r\\nof my apprehension; though I had occasion not long after to be\\r\\nconvinced, that howsoever his externals might be altered, he was at\\r\\nbottom the same individual Gawky, whom I have already described. For\\r\\ncoming home late one night from the house of a patient, I heard a noise\\r\\nin the street, and as I approached, perceived two gentlemen in custody,\\r\\nof three watchmen. The prisoners, who were miserable, disfigured with\\r\\ndirt, complained bitterly of the loss of their hats and wigs; and one\\r\\nof them, whom by his tongue I know to be a Scotchman, lamented most\\r\\npiteously, offering a guinea for his liberty, which the watchman\\r\\nrefused, alleging that one of his companions was wounded grievously,\\r\\nand that he must stand to the consequence. My prejudice in favour of my\\r\\nnative country was so strong, that I could not bear to see anybody\\r\\nbelonging to it in distress, and therefore, with one blow of my\\r\\nfaithful cudgel, knocked down the watchman who had hold of the person\\r\\nfor whom I was chiefly concerned. He was no sooner disengaged, than he\\r\\nbetook himself to his heels, and left me to maintain the dispute as I\\r\\nshould think proper; and, indeed, I came off but scurvily, for, before\\r\\nI could avail myself of my speed, I received a blow on the eye, from\\r\\none of the other two, that had well nigh deprived me of the use of that\\r\\norgan. However, I made shift to get home, where I was informed of\\r\\nCaptain Gawkyâ\\x80\\x99s being robbed and abused by a company of footpads, and\\r\\nwas ordered by my master to prepare an emollient glyster and paregoric\\r\\ndraught, in order to allay and compose the ferment of his spirits,\\r\\noccasioned by the barbarous treatment he had undergone, while he took\\r\\ntwelve ounces of blood from him immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I inquired into the particulars of this adventure, and understood\\r\\nby the servant that he came in just before me, without hat and wig, I\\r\\nmade no scruple of believing him to be the person I had released, and\\r\\nwas confirmed in my belief upon hearing his voice, to which (before\\r\\nthat event) I had long been a stranger.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy eye being considerably swelled and inflamed, I could not reflect\\r\\nupon my enterprise without cursing my own folly, and even resolving to\\r\\ndeclare the truth of the whole story in order to be revenged on the\\r\\ncowardly wretch for whom I had suffered: accordingly, next day after he\\r\\nhad told, in presence of my master, his wife and daughter, who came to\\r\\nhim, a thousand lies concerning the prowess he had shown in making his\\r\\nescape, I ventured to explain the mystery, and, calling in the evidence\\r\\nof my contused eye, upbraided him with cowardice and ingratitude. Gawky\\r\\nwas so astonished at this that he could not answer one word, and the\\r\\nrest of the company stared at one another; till at length my mistress\\r\\nreprimanded me for my insolent behaviour, and threatened to turn me\\r\\naway for my presumption. Upon which, Gawky (having recollected himself)\\r\\nobserved, as the young man might have mistaken another person for him,\\r\\nhe could forgive his insinuations, more especially as he seemed to have\\r\\nsuffered for his incivility; but advised me to be more certain in my\\r\\nconjectures for the future, before I ventured to publish them to the\\r\\nprejudice of any man. Miss applauded the Captainâ\\x80\\x99s generosity in\\r\\npardoning one who had so villainously aspersed him, and I began to\\r\\nimagine her praise was not at all disinterested. But the apothecary,\\r\\nwho perhaps had more penetration or less partiality than his wife and\\r\\ndaughter, differed from them in their sentiments of the matter, and\\r\\nexpressed himself to me in the shop in this manner: â\\x80\\x9cAh mon pauvre\\r\\nRoderique! you have more of de veracite dan of de prudenceâ\\x80\\x94bot mine\\r\\nvife and dater be diablement sage, and Monsieur le Capitaine un\\r\\nfanfaron, pardieu!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis eulogium on his wife and daughter, though spoken ironically by\\r\\nhim, was nevertheless literally just; by espousing the cause of Gawky,\\r\\nthe one obliged a valuable lodger, and the other acquired a husband at\\r\\na juncture when one was absolutely necessary. The young lady insinuated\\r\\nherself so artfully into the affection of this new lodger, that in less\\r\\nthan a fortnight, on pretence of going to the play, they drove away\\r\\ntogether to the Fleet, where they were married; and in the morning came\\r\\nhome, where they asked her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s and motherâ\\x80\\x99s blessing. The prudent\\r\\nparents, notwithstanding the precipitation with which the match was\\r\\ncarried on, did not think fit to refuse their approbation; for the\\r\\napothecary was not ill pleased to find his daughter married to a young\\r\\nman of a good prospect, who had not mentioned one syllable on the\\r\\narticle of her dowry; and his wife was rejoiced at being rid of a rival\\r\\nand a spy upon her. Whatever face Gawky put on the matter, my discovery\\r\\nof the adventure before related, and the reproaches I vented against\\r\\nhim, had stung him to the soul, and cherished the seeds of enmity so\\r\\nstrongly in his breast, that he imparted his indignation to his wife,\\r\\nwho being as desirous as himself to accomplish the ruin of one that not\\r\\nonly slighted her caresses, but was able on any occasion to discover\\r\\nparticulars not at all advantageous to her character, readily joined in\\r\\na conspiracy against me, which (had it taken effect as they expected)\\r\\nwould infallibly have brought me to an ignominious death.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy master having several times missed large quantities of medicines, of\\r\\nwhich I could give no account, at last lost all patience, and in plain\\r\\nterms taxed me with having embezzled them for my own use. As I could\\r\\nonly oppose my single asseveration to his suspicion, he told me one\\r\\nday, â\\x80\\x9cYour vord not be give me de satisfactionâ\\x80\\x94me find necessaire to\\r\\nchercher for my medicine; pardonnez moiâ\\x80\\x94il faut chercherâ\\x80\\x94me demand le\\r\\nclef of your coffre a cette heure.â\\x80\\x9d Then raising his voice to conceal\\r\\nthe fright he was in lest I should make any opposition, he went on,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOui! I charge you rendez le clef of your coffreâ\\x80\\x94moiâ\\x80\\x94si, moi qui vous\\r\\nparle.â\\x80\\x9d I was fired with so much resentment and disdain at this\\r\\naccusation, that I burst into tears, which he took for a sign of guilt;\\r\\nand pulling out my key, told him he might satisfy himself immediately,\\r\\nthough he would not find it so easy to satisfy me for the injury my\\r\\nreputation had suffered from his unjust suspicion. He took the key and\\r\\nmounted up to my chamber, attended by the whole family, saying, â\\x80\\x9cEh\\r\\nbien, nous verronsâ\\x80\\x94nous verrons.â\\x80\\x9d But what was my horror and amazement,\\r\\nwhen, opening my chest, he pulled out a handful of the very things that\\r\\nwere missing, and pronounced, â\\x80\\x9cAh, ha, vous etes bienvenuâ\\x80\\x94mardy, Mons.\\r\\nRoderique, you be fort innocent!â\\x80\\x9d I had not power to utter one word in\\r\\nmy own vindication, but stood motionless and silent, while everybody\\r\\npresent made their respective remarks on what appeared against me. The\\r\\nservants said they were sorry for my misfortune, and went away\\r\\nrepeating, â\\x80\\x9cWho would have thought it?â\\x80\\x9d My mistress took occasion from\\r\\nthis detection to rail against the practice of employing strangers in\\r\\ngeneral; and Mrs. Gawky, after having observed that she never had a\\r\\ngood opinion of my fidelity, proposed to have me carried before the\\r\\njustice and committed to Newgate immediately. Her husband was actually\\r\\nupon the stairs in his way for a constable, when Mr. Lavement knowing\\r\\nthe cost and trouble of a prosecution to which he must bind himself,\\r\\nand at the same time dreading lest some particulars of my confession\\r\\nmight affect his practice, called out. â\\x80\\x9cRestez, mon fils! restez, it be\\r\\nveritablement one grand crime which dis pauvre diable have\\r\\ncommittedâ\\x80\\x94bot peut-etre de good God give him de penitence, and me vill\\r\\nnot have upon mine head de blood of one sinner.â\\x80\\x9d The captain and his\\r\\nlady used all the Christian arguments their zeal could suggest to\\r\\nprevail upon the apothecary to pursue me to destruction, and\\r\\nrepresented the injustice he did to the community of which he was a\\r\\nmember, in letting a villain escape, who would not fail of doing more\\r\\nmischief in the world when he should reflect on his coming off so\\r\\neasily now; but their eloquence made no impression on my master, who\\r\\nturning to me said, â\\x80\\x9cGo, miserable, go from mine house quick,\\r\\nquick!â\\x80\\x94and make reparation for your mauvaise actions.â\\x80\\x9d By this time my\\r\\nindignation had roused me from the stupefaction in which I had hitherto\\r\\nremained and I began in this manner:â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cSir, appearances I own condemn\\r\\nme; but you are imposed upon as much as I am abused: I have fallen a\\r\\nsacrifice to the rancour of that scoundrelâ\\x80\\x9d (pointing to Gawky) â\\x80\\x9cwho\\r\\nhas found means to convey your goods hither, that the detection of them\\r\\nmight blast my reputation, and accomplish my destruction. His hatred to\\r\\nme is owing to a consciousness of his having wronged me in my own\\r\\ncountryâ\\x80\\x94for which injury he in a cowardly manner, refused me the\\r\\nsatisfaction of a gentleman; he knows, moreover, that I am no stranger\\r\\nto his dastardly behaviour in this town, which I have recounted before,\\r\\nand he is unwilling that such a testimony of his ingratitude and\\r\\npusillanimity should live upon the earth; for this reason he is guilty\\r\\nof the most infernal malice to bring about my ruin. And I am afraid,\\r\\nmadam (turning to Mrs. Gawky) you have too easily entered into the\\r\\nsentiments of your husband. I have often found you my enemy, and am\\r\\nwell acquainted with the occasion of your being so, which I donâ\\x80\\x99t at\\r\\npresent think proper to declare; but I would advise you, for your own\\r\\nsake, not to drive me to extremity.â\\x80\\x9d This address enraged her so much\\r\\nthat with a face as red us scarlet and the eyes of a fury, she strutted\\r\\nup to me and putting her hands in her side, spat in my face, saying, I\\r\\nwas a scandalous villain, but she defied my malice; and that unless her\\r\\npapa would not prosecute me like a thief as I was, she would not stay\\r\\nanother night under his roof. At the same time, Gawky assuming a big\\r\\nlook, told me, he scorned what lies I could invent against him; but\\r\\nthat, if I pretended to asperse his wife, he would put me to death. To\\r\\nthis threat I answered, â\\x80\\x9cI wish I could meet with thee in a desert,\\r\\nthat I might have an opportunity of punishing thee for thy perfidy\\r\\ntowards me, and rid the world of such a rascal. What hinders me this\\r\\nmoment,â\\x80\\x9d said I, seizing an old bottle that stood by, â\\x80\\x9cfrom doing\\r\\nmyself that justice?â\\x80\\x9d I had no sooner armed myself in this manner, than\\r\\nGawky and his father-in-law retired in such a hurry, that the one\\r\\noverturned the other, and they rolled together down stairs, while my\\r\\nmistress swooned away with fear, and her daughter asked if I intended\\r\\nto murder her. I gave her to understand, that nothing was farther from\\r\\nmy intention, that I would leave her to the stings of her own\\r\\nconscience; but was firmly resolved to slit her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s nose,\\r\\nwhenever fortune should offer a convenient opportunity. Then going down\\r\\nstairs, I met Lavement coming up trembling with the pestle in his hand,\\r\\nand Gawky behind armed with his sword, pushing him forward. I demanded\\r\\na parley: and having assured him of my pacific disposition, Gawky\\r\\nexclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cAh, villain! you have killed my dear wife.â\\x80\\x9d And the\\r\\napothecary cried, â\\x80\\x9cAh, coquin! vere is my shild?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe lady,â\\x80\\x9d said I,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cis above stairs, unhurt by me, and will, a few months hence, I believe\\r\\nreward your concern.â\\x80\\x9d Here she called to them, and desired they would\\r\\nlet the wretch go, and trouble themselves no further about him. To\\r\\nwhich request her father consented, observing, nevertheless, that my\\r\\nconversation was â\\x80\\x98very mysterious.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding it impossible to vindicate my innocence, I left the house\\r\\nimmediately, and went to the schoolmaster, with an intention of\\r\\nclearing myself to him, and asking his advice with regard to my future\\r\\nconduct; but, to my inexpressible vexation, he was gone to the country,\\r\\nwhere he would stay two or three days. I returned with a design of\\r\\nconsulting some acquaintance I had acquired in the neighbourhood; but\\r\\nmy story had taken air through the officiousness of the servants, and\\r\\nnot one of my friends would vouchsafe me a hearing. Thus I found\\r\\nmyself, by the iniquity of mankind, in a much more deplorable condition\\r\\nthan ever: for though I had been formerly as poor, my reputation was\\r\\nwithout blemish, and my health unimpaired till now; but at present my\\r\\ngood name was lost, my money gone, my friends were alienated, my body\\r\\nwas infected by an odious distemper; and my faithful Strap, who alone\\r\\ncould yield me pity and assistance, absent I knew not where.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first resolution I could take in this melancholy conjuncture, was\\r\\nto remove my clothes to the house of the person with whom I had\\r\\nformerly lodged, where I remained two days in hopes of getting another\\r\\nplace by the interest of Mr. Concordance, to whom I made no doubt of\\r\\nbeing able to vindicate my character; but in this supposition I\\r\\nreckoned without my best, for Lavement took care to be beforehand with\\r\\nme; and when I attempted to explain the whole affair to the\\r\\nschoolmaster, I found him so prepossessed against me, that he would\\r\\nscarce hear me to an end; but when I had finished my justification,\\r\\nshook his head, and beginning with his usual exclamation said, â\\x80\\x9cThat\\r\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t go down with me. I am very sorry I should have the misfortune of\\r\\nbeing concerned in the affair, but, however, shall be more cautious for\\r\\nthe future. I will trust no man from henceforwardâ\\x80\\x94no, not my father who\\r\\nbegat me, nor the brother who lay with me in my motherâ\\x80\\x99s womb: should\\r\\nDaniel rise from the dead, I would think him an impostor; and were the\\r\\ngenius of truth to appear, would question its veracity!â\\x80\\x9d I told him,\\r\\nthat one day it was possible he might be convinced of the injury I had\\r\\nsuffered, and repent of his premature determination. To which remark he\\r\\nanswered, the proof of my innocence would make his bowels vibrate with\\r\\njoy; â\\x80\\x9cbut till that shall happen,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, â\\x80\\x9cI must beg to have no\\r\\nmanner of connection with youâ\\x80\\x94my reputation is at stake. I shall be\\r\\nlooked upon as your accomplice and abettorâ\\x80\\x94people will say Jonathan\\r\\nWild was but a type of meâ\\x80\\x94boys will hoot at me as I pass along; and the\\r\\ncinder-wenches belch forth reproaches wafted in a gale impregnated with\\r\\ngin: I shall be notoriousâ\\x80\\x94the very butt of slander, and sink of\\r\\ninfamy!â\\x80\\x9d I was not in a humour to relish the climax of expressions upon\\r\\nwhich this gentleman valued himself in all his discourses; but, without\\r\\nany ceremony, took my leave, cursed with every sentiment of horror\\r\\nwhich my situation could suggest. I considered, however, in the\\r\\nintervals of my despondence, that I must, in some shape suit my expense\\r\\nto my calamitous circumstances, and with that view hired an apartment\\r\\nin a garret near St. Gilesâ\\x80\\x99s, at the rate of nine-pence per week.\\r\\n\\r\\nI one day, when I sat in this solitary retreat musing upon the\\r\\nunhappiness of my fate, was alarmed by a groan that issued from a\\r\\nchamber contiguous to mine, into which I immediately ran, and found a\\r\\nwoman stretched on a miserable truckle bed, without any visible signs\\r\\nof life. Having applied a smelling bottle to her nose, the blood began\\r\\nto revisit her cheeks, and she opened her eyes; but, good heaven! what\\r\\nwere the emotions of my soul, when I discovered her to be the same\\r\\nindividual lady who had triumphed over my heart, and to whose fate I\\r\\nhad almost been inseparably joined! Her deplorable situation filled my\\r\\nbreast with compassion. She knew me immediately; and, straining me\\r\\ngently in her arms, shed a torrent of tears, which I could not help\\r\\nincreasing. At length, casting a languishing look at me, she pronounced\\r\\nwith a feeble voice, â\\x80\\x9cDear Mr. Random, I do not deserve this concern at\\r\\nyour hands: I am a vile creature, who had a base design upon your\\r\\npersonâ\\x80\\x94suffer me, to expiate that, and all my other crimes, by a\\r\\nmiserable death, which will not fail to overtake me in a few hours.â\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\nencouraged her as much as I could, told her I forgave all her\\r\\nintentions with regard to me; and that, although my circumstances were\\r\\nextremely low, I would share my last farthing with her. I begged in the\\r\\nmeantime to know the immediate cause of that fit from which she had\\r\\njust recovered, and said, I would endeavour by my skill to prevent any\\r\\nmore such attacks. She seemed very much affected with this expression,\\r\\ntook my hand, and pressed it to her lips, saying, â\\x80\\x9cYou are too\\r\\ngenerous! I wish I could live to express my gratitudeâ\\x80\\x94but alas! I\\r\\nperish for want.â\\x80\\x9d Then shutting her eyes, she relapsed into another\\r\\nswoon. Such extremity of distress must have waked the most obdurate\\r\\nheart to sympathy and compassion; what effect then must it have had on\\r\\nmine, that was naturally prone to every tender passion? I ran\\r\\ndownstairs, and sent my landlady to a chemistâ\\x80\\x99s shop for some cinnamon\\r\\nwater, while I, returning to this unfortunate creatureâ\\x80\\x99s chamber, used\\r\\nall the means in my power to bring her to herself; this aim with much\\r\\ndifficulty I accomplished, and made her drink a glass of the cordial to\\r\\nrecruit her spirits: then I prepared a little mulled red wine and a\\r\\ntoast, which having taken, she found herself thoroughly revived, and\\r\\ninformed me, that she had not tasted food for eight and forty hours\\r\\nbefore. As I was impatient to know the occasion and nature of her\\r\\ncalamity, she gave me to understand, that she was a woman of the town\\r\\nby profession; that in the course of her adventures she found herself\\r\\ndangerously infected with a distemper, to which all of her class are\\r\\nparticularly subject; that her malady gaining ground every day, she\\r\\nbecame loathsome to herself and offensive to others: when she resolved\\r\\nto retire to some obscure corner where she might be cured with as\\r\\nlittle noise and expense as possible; that she had accordingly chosen\\r\\nthis place of retreat, and put herself into the hands of an advertising\\r\\ndoctor, who having fleeced her of all the money she had, or could\\r\\nprocure, left her three days ago in a worse condition than that in\\r\\nwhich he found her; that except the clothes on her back, she had pawned\\r\\nor sold everything that belonged to her to satisfy that rapacious\\r\\nquack, and quiet the clamour of her landlady, who still persisted in\\r\\nher threats to turn her out into the street. After having moralised\\r\\nupon these particulars, I proposed that she should lodge in the same\\r\\nroom with me, an expedient that would save some money: and assured her,\\r\\nI would undertake to cure her as well as my own, during which she\\r\\nshould partake of all the conveniences that I could afford to myself.\\r\\nShe embraced my offer with unfeigned acknowledgment, and I began to put\\r\\nit in practice immediately. I found her not only an agreeable\\r\\ncompanion, whose conversation greatly alleviated my chagrin, but also a\\r\\ncareful nurse, who served me with the utmost fidelity and affection.\\r\\nOne day, while I testified my surprise that a woman of her beauty, good\\r\\nsense, and education (for she had a large portion of each), could be\\r\\nreduced to such an infamous and miserable way of life, she answered\\r\\nwith a sigh, â\\x80\\x9cThese very advantages were the cause of my undoing.â\\x80\\x9d This\\r\\nremarkable reply inflamed my curiosity to such a degree, that I begged\\r\\nshe would favour me with the particulars of her story, and she complied\\r\\nin these words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe History of Miss Williams\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98My father was an eminent merchant in the city who having, in the\\r\\ncourse of trade, suffered very considerable losses, retired in his old\\r\\nage with his wife to a small estate in the country, which he had\\r\\npurchased with the remains of his fortune. At that time, I being but\\r\\neight years of age, was left in town for the convenience of education,\\r\\nboarded with an aunt, who was a rigid presbyterian, and confined me so\\r\\nclosely to what she called the duties of religion, that in time I grew\\r\\nweary of her doctrines, and by degrees received an aversion for the\\r\\ngood books, she daily recommended to my perusal. As I increased in age,\\r\\nand appeared with a person not disagreeable, I contracted a good deal\\r\\nof acquaintance among my own sex; one of whom, after having lamented\\r\\nthe restraint I was under from the narrowness of my auntâ\\x80\\x99s sentiments,\\r\\ntold me I must now throw off the prejudices of opinion imbibed under\\r\\nher influence and example, and learn to think for myself; for which\\r\\npurpose she advised me to read Shaftsbury, Tindal, Hobbes, and all the\\r\\nauthors that are remarkable for their deviation from the old way of\\r\\nthinking, and by comparing one with the other, I should soon be able to\\r\\nform a system of my own. I followed her advice; and whether it was\\r\\nowing to my prepossession against what I had formerly read, or the\\r\\nclearness of argument in these my new instructors, I know not; but I\\r\\nstudied them with pleasure, and in a short time became a professed\\r\\nfreethinker. Proud of my improvement, I argued in all companies, and\\r\\nthat with such success, that I soon acquired the reputation of a\\r\\nphilosopher, and few people durst undertake me in a dispute. I grew\\r\\nvain upon my good fortune, and at length pretended to make my aunt a\\r\\nproselyte to my opinion; but she no sooner perceived my drift than,\\r\\ntaking the alarm, she wrote to my father an account of my heresy, and\\r\\nconjured him, as he tendered the good of my soul, to remove me\\r\\nimmediately from the dangerous place where I had contracted such sinful\\r\\nprinciples. Accordingly, my father ordered me into the country, where I\\r\\narrived in the fifteenth year of my age, and, by his command gave him a\\r\\ndetail of all the articles of my faith, which he did not find so\\r\\nunreasonable as they had been represented. Finding myself suddenly\\r\\ndeprived of the company and pleasures of the town, I grew melancholy\\r\\nand it was some time before I could relish my situation. But solitude\\r\\nbecame every day more and more familiar to me and I consoled myself in\\r\\nmy retreat with the enjoyment of a good library, at such times as were\\r\\nnot employed in the management of the family (for my mother had been\\r\\ndead three years), in visiting, or some other party of rural diversion.\\r\\nHaving more imagination than judgment, I addicted myself too much to\\r\\npoetry and romance; and, in short, was looked upon as a very\\r\\nextraordinary person by everybody in the country where I resided.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I had one evening strayed, with a book in my hand, into a wood that\\r\\nbordered on the high road, at a little distance from my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house,\\r\\nwhen a certain drunken squire, riding by, perceived me, and crying,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHolloa, thereâ\\x80\\x99s a charming creature!â\\x80\\x9d alighted in a moment, caught me\\r\\nin his arms, and treated me so rudely that I shrieked as loud as I\\r\\ncould, and in the meantime opposed his violence with all the strength\\r\\nthat rage and resentment could inspire. During this struggle, another\\r\\nhorseman came up, who, seeing a lady so unworthily used, dismounted,\\r\\nand flew to my assistance. The squire, mad with disappointment, or\\r\\nprovoked with the reproaches of the other gentleman, quitted me, and\\r\\nrunning to his horse, drew a pistol from the saddle, and fired it at my\\r\\nprotector, who happily receiving no damage, went up, and, with the\\r\\nbutt-end of his whip laid him prostrate on the ground before he could\\r\\nuse the other, which his antagonist immediately seized, and, clapping\\r\\nto the squireâ\\x80\\x99s breast, threatened to put him to death for his\\r\\ncowardice and treachery. In this dilemma I interposed and begged his\\r\\nlife, which was granted to my request, after he had asked pardon, and\\r\\nswore his intention was only to obtain a kiss. However, my defender\\r\\nthought proper to unload the other pistol, and throw away the flints,\\r\\nbefore he gave him his liberty. This courteous stranger conducted me\\r\\nhome, where my father having learned the signal service he had done me,\\r\\nloaded him with caresses, and insisted on his lodging that night at our\\r\\nhouse. If the obligation he had conferred upon me justly inspired me\\r\\nwith sentiments of gratitude, his appearance and conversation seemed to\\r\\nentitle him to somewhat more. He was about the age of two-and-twenty,\\r\\namong the tallest of the middle size; had chestnut-coloured hair, which\\r\\nhe wore tied up in a ribbon; a high polished forehead, a nose inclining\\r\\nto the aquiline, lively blue eyes, red pouting lips, teeth as white as\\r\\nsnow, and a certain openness of countenanceâ\\x80\\x94but why need I describe any\\r\\nmore particulars of his person? I hope you will do me the justice to\\r\\nbelieve I do not flatter, when I say he was the exact resemblance of\\r\\nyou; and if I had not been well acquainted with his family and degree,\\r\\nI should have made no scruple of concluding that you was his brother.\\r\\nHe spoke and seemed to have no reserve: for what he said was ingenuous,\\r\\nsensible, and uncommon. â\\x80\\x9cIn short,â\\x80\\x9d said she, bursting into tears, â\\x80\\x9che\\r\\nwas formed for the ruin of our sex. His behaviour was modest and\\r\\nrespectful, but his looks were so significant, that I could easily\\r\\nobserve he secretly blessed the occasion that introduced him to my\\r\\nacquaintance. We learned from his discourse that he was the eldest son\\r\\nof a wealthy gentleman in the neighbourhood, to whose name we were no\\r\\nstrangersâ\\x80\\x94that he had been to visit an acquaintance in the country,\\r\\nfrom whose house he was returning home, when my shrieks brought him to\\r\\nmy rescue.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98All night long my imagination formed a thousand ridiculous\\r\\nexpectations: there was so much of knight-errantry in this gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncoming to the relief of a damsel in distress, with whom he immediately\\r\\nbecame enamoured, that all I had read of love and chivalry recurred to\\r\\nmy fancy; and I looked upon myself as a princess in some region of\\r\\nromance, who being delivered from the power of some brutal giant or\\r\\nsatyr, by a generous Oroondates, was bound in gratitude, as well as led\\r\\nby inclination, to yield up my affections to him without reserve. In\\r\\nvain did I endeavour to chastise these foolish conceits by reflections\\r\\nmore reasonable and severe: the amusing images took full possession of\\r\\nmy mind, and my dreams represented my hero sighing at my feet, in the\\r\\nlanguage of a despairing lover. Next morning after breakfast he took\\r\\nhis leave, when my father begged the favour of further acquaintance\\r\\nwith him; to which request he replied by a compliment to him, and a\\r\\nlook to me so full of eloquence and tenderness, that my whole soul\\r\\nreceived the soft impression. In a short time he repeated his visit;\\r\\nand as a recital of the particular steps he pursued to ruin me would be\\r\\ntedious and impertinent, let it suffice to say, he made it his business\\r\\nto insinuate himself into my esteem, by convincing me of his own good\\r\\nsense, and at the same time flattering my understanding. This task he\\r\\nperformed in the most artful manner, by seeming to contradict me often\\r\\nthrough misapprehension, that I might have an opportunity of clearing\\r\\nmyself the more to my own honour. Having thus secured my good opinion,\\r\\nhe began to give me some tokens of a particular passion, founded on a\\r\\nveneration of the qualities of my mind, and, as an accidental ornament,\\r\\nadmired the beauties of my person; till at being fully persuaded of his\\r\\nconquest, he chose a proper season for the theme, and disclosed his\\r\\nlove in terms so ardent and sincere, that it was impossible for me to\\r\\ndisguise the sentiments of my heart, and he received my approbation\\r\\nwith the most lively transport. After this mutual declaration, we\\r\\ncontrived to meet more frequently in private interviews, where we\\r\\nenjoyed the conversation of one another, in all the elevation of fancy\\r\\nand impatience of hope that reciprocal adoration can inspire. He\\r\\nprofessed his honourable intentions, of which I made no question;\\r\\nlamented the avaricious disposition of his father, who had destined him\\r\\nfor the arms of another, and vowed eternal fidelity with such an\\r\\nappearance of candour and devotionâ\\x80\\x94that I became a dupe to his deceit.\\r\\nCursed be the day on which I gave away my innocence and peace! Cursed\\r\\nbe my beauty that first attracted the attention of the seducer! Cursed\\r\\nbe my education, that, by refining my sentiments, made my heart the\\r\\nmore susceptible! Cursed be my good sense, that fixed me to one object,\\r\\nand taught me the preference I enjoyed was but my due! Had I been ugly,\\r\\nnobody would have tempted me; had I been ignorant, the charms of my\\r\\nperson would not have atoned for the coarseness of my conversation; had\\r\\nI been giddy, my vanity would have divided my inclinations, and my\\r\\nideas would have been so diffused, that I should never have listened to\\r\\nthe enchantments of one alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98But to return to my unfortunate story. After some months, the visits\\r\\nof my lover became less frequent, and his behaviour less warm: I\\r\\nperceived his coldness, my heart took the alarm, my tears reproached\\r\\nhim, and I insisted upon the performance of his promise to espouse me,\\r\\nthat, whatever should happen, my reputation might be safe. He seemed to\\r\\nacquiesce in my proposal, and left me on pretence of finding a proper\\r\\nclergyman to unite us in the bands of wedlock. But alas! the inconstant\\r\\nhad no intention to return. I waited a whole week with the utmost\\r\\nimpatience; sometimes doubting his honour, at other times inventing\\r\\nexcuses for him, and condemning myself for harbouring suspicions of his\\r\\nfaith. At length I understood from a gentleman who dined at our house,\\r\\nthat this perfidious wretch was on the point of setting out for London\\r\\nwith his bride, to buy clothes for their approaching nuptials. This\\r\\ninformation distracted me! Rage took possession of my soul; I denounced\\r\\na thousand imprecations, and formed as many schemes of revenge against\\r\\nthe traitor who had undone me. Then my resentment would subside to\\r\\nsilent sorrow. I recalled the tranquillity I lost, I wept over my\\r\\ninfatuation, and sometimes a ray of hope would intervene, and for a\\r\\nmoment cheer my drooping heart; I would revolve all the favourable\\r\\ncircumstances of his character, repeat the vows he made, ascribe his\\r\\nabsence to the vigilance of a suspicious father who compelled him to a\\r\\nmatch his soul abhorred, and comfort myself with the expectation of\\r\\nseeing him before the thing should be brought to any terms of\\r\\nagreement. But how vain was my imagination! That villain left me\\r\\nwithout remorse, and in a few days the news of his marriage were spread\\r\\nall over the country. My horror was then inconceivable; and had not the\\r\\ndesire of revenge diverted the resolution, I should infallibly have put\\r\\nan end to my miserable life. My father observed the symptoms of my\\r\\ndespair: and though I have good reason to believe he guessed the cause,\\r\\nwas at a great deal of pains to seem ignorant of my affliction, while\\r\\nhe endeavoured with parental fondness to alleviate my distress. I saw\\r\\nhis concern, which increased my anguish, and raised my fury against the\\r\\nauthor of my calamity to an implacable degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Having furnished myself with a little money, I made an elopement from\\r\\nthis unhappy parent in the night-time, and about break of day arrived\\r\\nat a small town, from whence a stage coach set out for London, in which\\r\\nI embarked, and next day alighted in town; the spirit of revenge having\\r\\nsupported me all the way against every other reflection, My first care\\r\\nwas to hire a lodging, in which I kept myself very retired, assumed a\\r\\nfeigned name, that my character and situation might be better\\r\\nconcealed. It was not long before I found out the house of my lover,\\r\\nwhither I immediately repaired in a transport of rage, determined to\\r\\nact some desperate deed for the satisfaction of my despair, though the\\r\\nhurry of my spirits would not permit me to concert or resolve upon a\\r\\nparticular plan. When I demanded admission to Lothario (so let me call\\r\\nhim), I was desired to send up my name and business; but this I\\r\\nrefused, telling the porter I had business for his masterâ\\x80\\x99s private\\r\\near; upon which I was conducted into a parlour until he should be\\r\\ninformed of my request. There I remained about a quarter of an hour,\\r\\nwhen a servant entered and told me his master was engaged with company,\\r\\nand begged to be excused at that time. My temper could hold out no\\r\\nlonger. I pulled out a poniard from my bosom, where I had concealed it,\\r\\nand rushing out flew up stairs like a fury, exclaiming, â\\x80\\x9cWhereâ\\x80\\x99s this\\r\\nperfidious villain? could I plunge this dagger into his false heart, I\\r\\nshould then die satisfied!â\\x80\\x9d The noise I made alarmed not only the\\r\\nservants, but the company also, who hearing my threats came forward to\\r\\nthe staircase to see was the matter. I was seized, disarmed, and\\r\\nwithheld by two footmen; and in this situation felt the most exquisite\\r\\ntorture in beholding my undoer approach with his young wife. I could\\r\\nnot endure the sight, was deprived of my senses, and fell into a severe\\r\\nfit, during which I know not how I was treated; but when I recovered\\r\\nthe use of reflection, found myself on a bed in a paltry apartment,\\r\\nwhere I was attended by an old woman, who asked a thousand impertinent\\r\\nquestions relating to my condition, and informed me that my behaviour\\r\\nhad thrown the whole family into confusion; that Lothario affirmed I\\r\\nwas mad, and proposed to have me sent to Bedlam; but my lady persuaded\\r\\nherself there was more in my conduct than he cared should be known, and\\r\\nhad taken to her bed on bare suspicion, having first ordered that I\\r\\nshould be narrowly looked to. I heard all she said without making any\\r\\nother reply than desiring she would do me the favour to call a chair;\\r\\nbut this she told me could not be done without her masterâ\\x80\\x99s consent,\\r\\nwhich, however, was easily procured, and I was conveyed to my lodgings\\r\\nin a state of mind that baffles all description. The agitation of my\\r\\nthoughts produced a fever, which brought on a miscarriage; and I\\r\\nbelieve it is well for my conscience that heaven thus disposed of my\\r\\nburden; for let me own to you with penitence and horror, if I had\\r\\nbrought a living child into the world, my frenzy would have prompted me\\r\\nto sacrifice the little innocent to my resentment of the fatherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ninfidelity.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98After this event my rage abated, and my hate became more deliberate\\r\\nand calm: when one day my landlady informed me that there was a\\r\\ngentleman below who desired to see me, he having something of\\r\\nconsequence to impart, which he was sure would contribute to my peace\\r\\nof mind. I was exceedingly alarmed at this declaration, which I\\r\\nattempted to interpret a thousand ways; and before I came to any\\r\\ndetermination he entered my room, with an apology for intruding without\\r\\nmy knowledge or consent. I surveyed him some time, and not being able\\r\\nto recollect his face, demanded, with a faltering accent, what his\\r\\nbusiness was with me? Upon which he desired I would give him a\\r\\nparticular audience, and he did not doubt of communicating something\\r\\nthat would conduce to my satisfaction and repose. As I thought myself\\r\\nsufficiently guarded against any violence, I granted his request, and\\r\\nbade the woman withdraw. The stranger, then advancing, gave me to\\r\\nunderstand that he was well acquainted with the particulars of my\\r\\nstory, having been informed of them from Lotharioâ\\x80\\x99s own mouthâ\\x80\\x94that from\\r\\nthe time he knew my misfortunes he had entertained a detestation for\\r\\nthe author of them, which had of late been increased and inflamed to a\\r\\ndesire of revenge, by a piece of dishonourable conduct towards himâ\\x80\\x94that\\r\\nhearing of my melancholy situation, he had come with an intention of\\r\\noffering his assistance and comfort, and was ready to espouse my\\r\\nquarrel, and forthwith take vengeance on my seducer, provided I would\\r\\ngrant him one consideration, which, he hoped, I should see no reason to\\r\\nrefuse. Had all the artifice of hell been employed in composing a\\r\\npersuasive, it could not have had a more instantaneous or favourable\\r\\neffect than this discourse had upon me. I was transported with a\\r\\ndelirium of gloomy joy. The contract was made; he devoted himself to my\\r\\nrevenge, undertook to murder Lothario that very night, and to bring me\\r\\nan account of his death before morning. Accordingly, about two of the\\r\\nclock, he was introduced to my chamber, and assured me that my\\r\\nperfidious lover was no more: that although he was not entitled to such\\r\\nan honourable proceeding, he had fairly challenged him to the field,\\r\\nwhere he upbraided him with his treachery towards me, for whom, he told\\r\\nme, his sword was drawn, and after a few passes left him weltering in\\r\\nhis blood. I was so savaged by my wrongs, that I delighted in the\\r\\nrecital of this adventure, made him repeat the particulars and feasted\\r\\nmy eyes on the blood that remained on his clothes and sword. My\\r\\nimagination was so engrossed by these ideas, that in my sleep I dreamed\\r\\nLothario appeared before me pale, mangled, and bloody, blamed my\\r\\nrashness, protested his innocence, and pleaded his cause so\\r\\npathetically, that I was convinced of his fidelity, and waked in a fit\\r\\nof horror and remorse. I dropped asleep again, and the same apparition\\r\\nrecurred to my fancy. In short, I passed the night in great misery, and\\r\\nlooked upon my avenger with such abhorrence, that in the morning,\\r\\nperceiving my aversion, he insinuated there was still a possibility of\\r\\nLotharioâ\\x80\\x99s recovery: it was quite true he left him wounded on the\\r\\nground, but not quite dead, and perhaps his hurts might not be mortal.\\r\\nAt these words I started up, bade him fly for intelligence, and if he\\r\\ncould not bring me tidings of Lotharioâ\\x80\\x99s safety, at least consult his\\r\\nown, and never return; for I was resolved to surrender myself to\\r\\njustice, and declare all I knew of the affair, that, if possible I\\r\\nmight expiate my own guilt, by incurring the rigours of a sincere\\r\\nrepentance and ignominious death. He very coolly represented the\\r\\nunreasonableness of my prejudice against him, who had done nothing but\\r\\nwhat his love of me inspired, and honour justified: that now he had, at\\r\\nthe risk of his life, been subservient to my revenge, I was about to\\r\\ndiscard him as an infamous agent, occasionally necessary; and that,\\r\\neven if he should be so lucky as to bring news of Lotharioâ\\x80\\x99s safety, it\\r\\nwas probable my former resentment might revive, and I would upbraid him\\r\\nwith having failed in his undertaking. I assured him, that on the\\r\\ncontrary, he should be dearer to me than ever, as I then should be\\r\\nconvinced he acted more on the principles of a man of honour than on\\r\\nthose of a mercenary assassin, and scorned to take away the life of an\\r\\nadversary, how inveterate soever, which fortune had put in his power.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, then madam,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cwhatever may have happened, I shall find\\r\\nit no difficult matter to acquit myself in point of honour;â\\x80\\x9d and took\\r\\nhis leave in order to inquire into the consequences of his duel. I was\\r\\nnow more sensible than ever of the degrees of guilt and misery; all the\\r\\naffliction I had suffered hitherto was owing to my own credulity and\\r\\nweakness, and my conscience could only accuse me of venial crimes; but\\r\\nnow that I looked upon myself as a murderer, it is impossible to\\r\\nexpress the terrors of my imagination, which was incessantly haunted by\\r\\nthe image of the deceased, and my bosom stung with the most exquisite\\r\\nagonies, of which I saw no end. At length, Horatio (for so I shall call\\r\\nmy new friend) returned, and telling me I had nothing to fear,\\r\\ndelivered into my hands a billet containing these words.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMadam,\\r\\n    â\\x80\\x9cAs I understand it is of consequence to your peace, I take this\\r\\n    liberty to inform you, that the wounds I received from Horatio are\\r\\n    not mortal. This satisfaction my humanity could not deny, even to a\\r\\n    person who has endeavoured to disturb the repose as well as the\\r\\n    life of\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLothario.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Being well acquainted with this hand, I had no reason to suspect an\\r\\nimposition in this letter, which I read over and over with a transport\\r\\nof joy, and caressed Horatio so much that he appeared the happiest man\\r\\nalive. Thus was I won from despair by the menaces of a greater\\r\\nmisfortune than that which depressed me. Griefs are like usurpers,â\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nmost powerful deposes all the rest. But my raptures were not lasting:\\r\\nthat very letter which in a manner re-established my tranquillity, in a\\r\\nlittle time banished my peace. His unjust reproaches, while they waked\\r\\nmy resentment, recalled my former happiness, and filled my soul with\\r\\nrage and sorrow. Horatio, perceiving the situation of my mind,\\r\\nendeavoured to divert my chagrin, by treating me with all the\\r\\namusements and entertainments of the town. I was gratified with every\\r\\nindulgence I could desire; introduced into the company of women in my\\r\\nown situation, by whom an uncommon deference was paid to me; and I\\r\\nbegan to lose all remembrance of my former condition, when an accident\\r\\nbrought it back to my view with all its interesting circumstances.\\r\\nDiverting myself one day with some newspapers, which I had not before\\r\\nperused, the following advertisement attracted my attention:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x9cWhereas a young gentlewoman disappeared from her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house in\\r\\nthe county of â\\x80\\x94, about the end of September, on account (as is\\r\\nsupposed) of some uneasiness of mind, and has not been as yet heard of.\\r\\nWhoever will give any information about her to Mr. â\\x80\\x94 of Grayâ\\x80\\x99s Inn,\\r\\nshall be handsomely rewarded; or if she will return to the arms of her\\r\\ndisconsolate parent, she will be received with the utmost tenderness,\\r\\nwhatever reason she may have to think otherwise, and may be the means\\r\\nof prolonging the life of a father already weighed down almost to the\\r\\ngrave with age and sorrow.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98This pathetic remonstrance had such an effect on me, that I was fully\\r\\nresolved to return, like the prodigal son, and implore the forgiveness\\r\\nof him who gave me life; but, alas! Upon inquiry, I found he had paid\\r\\nhis debt to nature a month before, lamenting my absence to his last\\r\\nhour, having left his fortune to a stranger, as a mark of his\\r\\nresentment of my unkind and undutiful behaviour. Penetrated with\\r\\nremorse on this occasion, I sank into the most profound melancholy, and\\r\\nconsidered myself as the immediate cause of his death. I lost all\\r\\nrelish for company; and, indeed, most of my acquaintances no sooner\\r\\nperceived my change of temper, than they abandoned me. Horatio,\\r\\ndisgusted at my insensibility, or from some other cause, became colder\\r\\nand colder every day, till at last he left me altogether, without\\r\\nmaking any apology for his conduct, or securing me against the miseries\\r\\nof want, as a man of honour ought to have done, considering the share\\r\\nhe had in my ruin; for I afterwards learned, that the quarrel between\\r\\nLothario and him was a story trumped up to rid the one of my\\r\\nimportunities, and give the other a recommendation to me, which, it\\r\\nseems, he desired, upon seeing me at the house of my seducer. Reduced\\r\\nto this extremity, I cursed my own simplicity, uttered horrid\\r\\nimprecations against the treachery of Horatio; and, as I became every\\r\\nday more and more familiarised to the loss of innocence, resolved to be\\r\\nrevenged on the sex in general, by practising their own arts upon\\r\\nthemselves. Nor was an opportunity long wanting: an old gentlewoman,\\r\\nunder pretence of sympathising, visited me, and after having condoled\\r\\nme on my misfortunes, and professed a disinterested friendship, began\\r\\nto display the art of her occupation, in encomiums on my beauty, and\\r\\ninvectives against the wretch who had forsaken me; insinuating withal,\\r\\nthat it would be my own fault if I did not still make my fortune by the\\r\\nextraordinary qualifications with which nature had endowed me. I soon\\r\\nunderstood her drift, and gave her such encouragement to explain\\r\\nherself, that we came to an agreement immediately to divide whatever\\r\\nprofits might accrue from such gallants as she should introduce to my\\r\\nacquaintance. The first stroke of my dissimulation was practised upon a\\r\\ncertain judge, to whom I was recommended by this matron as an innocent\\r\\ncreature just arrived from the country.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Williams interrupted by a bailiff, who carries her to the\\r\\nMarshalseaâ\\x80\\x94I accompany herâ\\x80\\x94prove she is not the person named in the\\r\\nwritâ\\x80\\x94the bailiff is fain to discharge herâ\\x80\\x94we shift our lodgingâ\\x80\\x94her\\r\\nstory, and my reflections thereuponâ\\x80\\x94progress of a common woman of the\\r\\ntownâ\\x80\\x94resolves to quit that way of life\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHer story was here interrupted by a rap at the door, which I no sooner\\r\\nopened, than three or four terrible fellows rushed in, one of whom\\r\\naccosted my fellow-lodger thus: â\\x80\\x9cMadam, your servantâ\\x80\\x94you must do me the\\r\\nfavour to come along with me, I have a writ against you.â\\x80\\x9d While the\\r\\nbailiff (for so he was) spoke thus, his followers surrounded the\\r\\nprisoner, and began to handle her very roughly. This treatment incensed\\r\\nme so much, that I snatched up the poker and would certainly have used\\r\\nit in defence of the lady, without any regard to the strength and\\r\\nnumber of her adversaries, had she not begged me, with a composure of\\r\\ncountenance for which I could not account, to use no violence on her\\r\\nbehalf, which could be of no service to her, but might be very\\r\\ndetrimental to myself. Then turning to the leader of this formidable\\r\\ntroop, she desired to see the writ, and having perused it, said with a\\r\\nfaltering voice, â\\x80\\x9cI am not the person whose name is here mentioned,\\r\\narrest me at your peril.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAy, ay, madam,â\\x80\\x9d replied the catchpole. â\\x80\\x9cWe\\r\\nshall prove your identity. In the meantime, whither will you be pleased\\r\\nto be carried, to my house, or to jail?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf I must be confined,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nshe, â\\x80\\x9cI would rather be in your house than in a common jail.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell,\\r\\nwell,â\\x80\\x9d answered he, â\\x80\\x9cif you have money enough in your pocket, you shall\\r\\nbe entertained like a princess.â\\x80\\x9d But when she acquainted him with her\\r\\npoverty, he swore he never gave credit, and ordered one of his\\r\\nmyrmidons to call a coach, to carry her to the Marshalsea at once.\\r\\nWhile they waited for the convenience, she took me aside, and bade me\\r\\nbe under no concern on her account, for she knew how to extricate\\r\\nherself from this difficulty very soon, and perhaps gain something by\\r\\nthe occasion. Although her discourse was a mystery to me, I was very\\r\\nwell pleased with her assurance; and when the coach came to the door, I\\r\\noffered to accompany her to prison, to which proposal, after much\\r\\nentreaty, she consented.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we arrived at the gate of the Marshalsea, our conductor alighted,\\r\\nand having demanded entrance, presented the writ to the turnkey, who no\\r\\nsooner perceived the name of Elizabeth Cary than he cried, â\\x80\\x9cAh, ah: my\\r\\nold acquaintance Bet! Iâ\\x80\\x99m glad to see thee with all my heart.â\\x80\\x9d So\\r\\nsaying, he opened the coach door, and helped her to dismount; but when\\r\\nhe observed her face, he started back, saying, â\\x80\\x9cWho have we got here?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThe bailiff, alarmed at this interrogation, cried with some emotion,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWho should it be but the prisoner, Elizabeth Cary?â\\x80\\x9d The turnkey\\r\\nreplied, â\\x80\\x9cThat Elizabeth Cary! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be hanged if thatâ\\x80\\x99s Elizabeth Cary\\r\\nmore than my grandmother.â\\x80\\x9d Here the lady thought fit to interpose, and\\r\\ntell the catchpole, if he had taken her word for it at first, he might\\r\\nhave saved himself and her a great deal of trouble. â\\x80\\x9cIt may be so,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nanswered he, â\\x80\\x9cbut Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have further evidence that you are not the\\r\\nperson, before you and I part.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cyou shall have\\r\\nfurther evidence, to your cost.â\\x80\\x9d Then we adjourned into the lodge, and\\r\\ncalled for a bottle of wine, where my companion wrote a direction to\\r\\ntwo of her acquaintance, and begged the favour of me to go to their\\r\\nlodgings, and request them to come to her immediately. I found them\\r\\ntogether at a house in Brydges Street, Drury Lane, and as they were\\r\\nluckily unengaged, they set out with me in a hackney-coach without\\r\\nhesitation, after I had related the circumstances of the affair, which\\r\\nflattered them with the hopes of seeing a bailiff trounced; for there\\r\\nis an antipathy as natural between women of that class and bailiffs, as\\r\\nthat subsisting between mice and cats. Accordingly, when they entered\\r\\nthe lodge, they embraced the prisoner very affectionately by the name\\r\\nof Nancy Williams, and asked how long she had been nabbed, and for\\r\\nwhat? On hearing the particulars of her adventure repeated, they\\r\\noffered to swear before a justice of peace that she was not the person\\r\\nmentioned in the writ, whom, it seems, they all knew; but the bailiff,\\r\\nwho was by the time convinced of his mistake, told them he would not\\r\\nput them to that trouble. â\\x80\\x9cLadies,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s no harm doneâ\\x80\\x94you\\r\\nshall give me leave to treat you with another bottle, and then weâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\npart friends.â\\x80\\x9d This proposal was not at all relished by the sisterhood:\\r\\nand Miss Williams told him, sure he did not imagine her such a fool as\\r\\nto be satisfied with a paltry glass of sour wine? Here the turnkey\\r\\ninterrupted her by affirming with an oath, that the wine was as good as\\r\\never was tipped over tongue. â\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d continued she, â\\x80\\x9cthat may be, but\\r\\nwere it the best of champagne, it is no recompense for the damage I\\r\\nhave suffered both in character and health, by being wrongfully dragged\\r\\nto jail; at this rate, no innocent person is safe, since an officer of\\r\\njustice, out of malice, private pique, or mistake, may injure and\\r\\noppress the subject with impunity; but, thank heaven, I live under the\\r\\nprotection of laws that will not suffer such insults to pass\\r\\nunpunished, and I know very well how to procure redress.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Vulture,\\r\\nfor that was the bailiffâ\\x80\\x99s name, finding he had to deal with one who\\r\\nwould not be imposed upon, began to look very sullen and perplexed,\\r\\nand, leaning his forehead on his hand, entered into a deliberation with\\r\\nhimself, which lasted a few minutes, and then broke out in a volley of\\r\\ndreadful curses against the old jade our landlady, as he called her,\\r\\nfor having misinformed him. After much wrangling and swearing, the\\r\\nmatter was referred to the decision of the turnkey, who calling for the\\r\\nother bottle, mulcted the bailiff in all the liquor that had been\\r\\ndrunk, coach hire, and a couple of guineas for the use of the\\r\\nplaintiff. The money was immediately deposited; Miss Williams gratified\\r\\nthe two evidences with one half, and putting the other in her pocket\\r\\ndrove home with me, leaving the catchpole grumbling over his loss, yet\\r\\npleased in the main, for having so cheaply got clear of a business that\\r\\nmight have cost him ten times the sum, and his place to boot. This\\r\\nguinea was a very seasonable relief to us, who were reduced to great\\r\\nnecessity, six of my shirts, and almost all my clothes, except those on\\r\\nmy back, having been either pawned or sold for our maintenance before\\r\\nthis happened. As we resented the behaviour of our landlady, our first\\r\\ncare was to provide ourselves with another lodging, whither we removed\\r\\nnext day, with an intention to keep ourselves as retired as possible,\\r\\nuntil our cure should be completed. When we were fixed in our new\\r\\nhabitation, I entreated her to finish the story of her life, which she\\r\\npursued in this manner:â\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98The success of our experiment on the judge encouraged us to practice\\r\\nthe same deceit on others; but this harvest lasted not long, my\\r\\ncharacter taking air, and my directress deserting me for some new game.\\r\\nThen I took lodgings near Charing-Cross, at two guineas a week, and\\r\\nbegan to entertain company in a public manner; but my income being too\\r\\nsmall to defray my expenses, I was obliged to retrench, and enter into\\r\\narticles with the porters of certain taverns, who undertook to find\\r\\nemployment enough for me, provided I would share my profits with them.\\r\\nAccordingly, I was almost every night engaged with company, among whom\\r\\nI was exposed to every mortification, danger, and abuse, that flow from\\r\\ndrunkenness and brutality. As my spirit was not sufficiently humbled to\\r\\nthe will, nor my temper calculated for the conversation of my gallants,\\r\\nit was impossible for me to overcome an aversion I felt for my\\r\\nprofession, which manifested itself in a settled gloom on my\\r\\ncountenance, and disgusted those sons of mirth and riot so much, that I\\r\\nwas frequently used in a shocking manner, and kicked down stairs with\\r\\ndisgrace. The messengers, seeing me disagreeable to their benefactors\\r\\nand employers, seldom troubled me with a call, and I began to find\\r\\nmyself almost totally neglected.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98To contribute towards my support I was fain to sell my watch, rings,\\r\\ntrinkets, with the best part of my clothes; and I was one evening\\r\\nmusing by myself on misery before me when I received a message from a\\r\\ntavern, whither I repaired in a chair, and was introduced to a\\r\\ngentleman dressed like an officer, with whom I supped in a sumptuous\\r\\nmanner. In the morning, when I awoke, I found my gallant had got up,\\r\\nand, drawing aside the curtain, could not perceive him in the room. I\\r\\nwaited a full hour for his return, and then in the greatest perplexity,\\r\\nrose up and rang the bell. When the waiter came to the door, he found\\r\\nit locked, and desired admittance, which I granted, after observing,\\r\\nwith great surprise, that the key remained on the inside, as when we\\r\\nwent to bed. I no sooner inquired for the captain, than the fellow,\\r\\nstaring with a distracted look, cried, â\\x80\\x9cHow, madam, is he not abed?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nAnd when he was satisfied as to that particular, ran into a closet\\r\\nadjoining to the chamber, the window of which he found open. Through\\r\\nthis the adventurer had got upon a wall, front whence he dropped down\\r\\ninto a court and escaped, leaving me to be answerable not only for the\\r\\nreckoning, but also for a large silver tankard and posset-bowl, which\\r\\nhe had carried off with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98It is impossible to describe the consternation I was under, when I saw\\r\\nmyself detained as a thiefâ\\x80\\x99s accomplice; for I was looked upon in that\\r\\nlight, and carried before a justice, who mistaking my confusion for a\\r\\nsign of guilt committed me, after a short examination, to Bridewell,\\r\\nhaving admonished me, as the only means to save my life, to turn\\r\\nevidence, and impeach my confederate. I now concluded the vengeance of\\r\\nHeaven had overtaken me, and that I must soon finish my career by an\\r\\nignominious death. This reflection sank so deep into my soul, that I\\r\\nwas for some days deprived of my reason, and actually believed myself\\r\\nin hell, tormented by fiends. Indeed, there needs not a very\\r\\nextravagant imagination to form that idea: for of all the scenes on\\r\\nearth that of Bridewell approaches nearest the notion I had always\\r\\nentertained of the regions. Here I saw nothing but rage, anguish and\\r\\nimpiety, and heard nothing but groans, curses, and blasphemy. In the\\r\\nmidst of this hellish crew, I was subjected to the tyranny of a\\r\\nbarbarian, who imposed upon me tasks that I could not possibly perform,\\r\\nand then punished my incapacity with the utmost rigour and inhumanity.\\r\\nI was often whipped into a swoon, and lashed out of it (during which\\r\\nmiserable interval, I was robbed by my fellow-prisoners of everything\\r\\nabout me, even to my cap, shoes, and stockings): I was not only\\r\\ndestitute of necessaries, but even of food, so that my wretchedness was\\r\\nextreme. Not one of my acquaintance to whom I imparted my situation,\\r\\nwould grant me the least succour or regard, on pretence of my being\\r\\ncommitted for theft, and my landlord refused to part with some of my\\r\\nown clothes which I sent for, because I was indebted to him for a\\r\\nweekâ\\x80\\x99s lodging.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Overwhelmed with calamity, I grew desperate, and resolved to put an\\r\\nend to my grievances and life together: for this purpose I got up in\\r\\nthe middle of the night, when I thought everybody around me asleep, and\\r\\nfixing one end of a large hook in the ceiling, that supported the\\r\\nscales on which the hemp is weighed, I stood upon a chair, and making a\\r\\nnoose on the other end, put my neck into it, with an intention to hang\\r\\nmyself; but before I could adjust the knot I was surprised and\\r\\nprevented by two women, who had been awake all the while and suspected\\r\\nmy design. In the morning, my attempt was published among the prisoners\\r\\nand punished with thirty stripes, the pain of which, co-operating with\\r\\nmy disappointment and disgrace, bereft me of my senses, and threw me\\r\\ninto an ecstacy of madness, during which I tore the flesh from my bones\\r\\nwith my teeth, and dashed my head against the pavement; so that they\\r\\nwere obliged to set a watch over me, to restrain me from doing further\\r\\nmischief to myself and others. This fit of frenzy continued three days,\\r\\nat the end of which I grew calm and sullen: but as the desire of making\\r\\naway with myself still remained, I came to a determination of starving\\r\\nmyself to death, and with that view refused all sustenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Whether it was owing to the want of opposition, or to the weakness of\\r\\nnature, I know not; but on the second day of my fast, I found my\\r\\nresolution considerably impaired, and the calls of hunger almost\\r\\ninsupportable. At this critical conjuncture a lady was brought into the\\r\\nprison, with whom I had contracted an acquaintance while I lived with\\r\\nHoratio; she was then on the same footing as I was, but afterwards\\r\\nquarrelling with her gallant, and not finding another to her mind,\\r\\naltered her scheme of life, and set up a coffee-house among the\\r\\nhundreds in Drury, where she entertained gentlemen with claret, arrack,\\r\\nand the choice of half-a-dozen damsels who lived in her house. This\\r\\nserviceable matron having neglected to gratify a certain justice for\\r\\nthe connivance she enjoyed, was indicted at the quarter sessions, in\\r\\nconsequence of which her bevy was dispersed, and herself committed to\\r\\nBridewell. She had not been long there before she learned my disaster,\\r\\nand coming up to me, after a compliment of condolence, inquired into\\r\\nthe particulars of my fate. While we were engaged in discourse\\r\\ntogether, the master came and told me, that the fellow on whose account\\r\\nI had suffered was taken, that he had confessed the theft, and cleared\\r\\nme of any concern in the affair; for which reason he, the master, had\\r\\norders to discharge me, and that I was from that moment free.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98This piece of news soon banished all thoughts of death, and had such\\r\\nan instantaneous effect on my countenance, that Mrs. Coupler (the lady\\r\\nthen present), hoping to find her account in me, very generously\\r\\noffered to furnish me with what necessaries I wanted, and take me into\\r\\nher own house as soon as she could compromise matters with the\\r\\njustices. The conditions of her offer were, that I should pay three\\r\\nguineas weekly for my board, and a reasonable consideration besides,\\r\\nfor the use of such clothes and ornaments as she should supply me with,\\r\\nto be deducted from the first profits of my occupation. These were hard\\r\\nterms, but not to be rejected by one who was turned out helpless and\\r\\nnaked into the wide world, without a friend to pity or assist her. I\\r\\ntherefore embraced her proposal, and she being bailed in a few hours,\\r\\ntook me home with her in a coach. As I was by this time conscious of\\r\\nhaving formerly disgusted my admirers by my reserved loud haughty\\r\\nbehaviour, I now endeavoured to conquer that disposition, and the\\r\\nsudden change of my fortune giving me a flow of spirits, I appeared in\\r\\nthe most winning and gay manner I could assume. Having the advantage of\\r\\na good voice and education, I exerted my talents to the uttermost, and\\r\\nsoon became the favourite with all company. This success alarmed the\\r\\npride and jealousy of Mrs. Coupler, who could not bear the thoughts of\\r\\nbeing eclipsed: she therefore made a merit of her envy, and whispered\\r\\namong the customers that I was unsound. There needed no more to ruin my\\r\\nreputation and blast my prosperity; everybody shunned me with marks of\\r\\naversion and disdain, and in a very short time I was as solitary as\\r\\never. Want of gallants was attended with want of money to satisfy my\\r\\nmalicious landlady, who having purposely given me credit to the amount\\r\\nof eleven pounds, took out a writ against me and I was arrested in her\\r\\nown house. Though the room was crowded with people when the bailiff\\r\\nentered, not one of them had compassion enough to mollify my\\r\\nprosecutrix, far less to pay the debt; they even laughed at my tears,\\r\\nand one of them bade me be of good cheer, for I should not want\\r\\nadmirers in Newgate.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98At this instant a sea-lieutenant came in, and seeing my plight, began\\r\\nto inquire into the circumstances of my misfortune. â\\x80\\x9cHarkee, my girl,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe inquired â\\x80\\x9chow far have you overrun the constable?â\\x80\\x9d I told him that\\r\\nthe debt amounted to eleven pounds, besides the expenses of the writ.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAn that be all,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cyou shanâ\\x80\\x99t go to the bilboes this bout.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nAnd taking out his purse, he paid the money, discharged the bailiff,\\r\\nand telling me I had got into the wrong port, advised me to seek out a\\r\\nmore convenient harbour, where I could be safely hove down; for which\\r\\npurpose he made me a present of five guineas more. I was so touched\\r\\nwith this singular piece of generosity, that for some time I had not\\r\\npower to thank him. However, as soon as I recollected myself, I begged\\r\\nthe favour of him to go with me to the next tavern, where I explained\\r\\nthe nature of my disaster, and convinced him of the falsehood of what\\r\\nwas reported to my prejudice so effectually, that he from that moment\\r\\nattached himself to me, and we lived in great harmony together, until\\r\\nhe was obliged to go to sea, where he perished in a storm.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Having lost my benefactor, and almost consumed the remains of his\\r\\nbounty, I saw myself in danger of relapsing into my former necessity,\\r\\nand began to be very uneasy at the prospect of bailiffs and jails! when\\r\\none of the sisterhood advised me to take lodgings in a part of the town\\r\\nwhere I was unknown, and pass for an heiress, by which artifice I might\\r\\nentrap somebody to be my husband, who would possibly be able to allow\\r\\nme a handsome maintenance, or at worst screen me from the dread and\\r\\ndanger of a prison, by becoming liable for whatever debts I should\\r\\ncontract. I approved of this scheme, towards the execution of which my\\r\\ncompanion clubbed her wardrobe, and undertook to live with me in\\r\\nquality of my maid, with the proviso that she should be reimbursed and\\r\\nhandsomely considered out of the profits of my success. She was\\r\\nimmediately detached to look out for a convenient place, and that very\\r\\nday hired a genteel apartment in Park Street, whither I moved in a\\r\\ncouch loaded with her baggage, and my own. I made my first appearance\\r\\nin a blue riding habit trimmed with silver; and my maid acted her part\\r\\nso artfully, that in a day or two my fame spread all over the\\r\\nneighbourhood, and I was said to be a rich heiress just arrived from\\r\\nthe country. This report brought a swarm of gay young fellows about me;\\r\\nbut I soon found them to be all indigent adventurers like myself, who\\r\\ncrowded to me like crows to a carrion, with a view of preying upon my\\r\\nfortune. I maintained, however, the appearance of wealth as long as\\r\\npossible, in hopes of gaining some admirer more for my purpose, and at\\r\\nlength attracted the regard of one who would have satisfied my wishes,\\r\\nand managed matters so well, that a day was actually fixed for our\\r\\nnuptials. In the interim, he begged leave to introduce an intimate\\r\\nfriend to me, which request, as I could not refuse, I had the extreme\\r\\nmortification and surprise to see, next night, in that friend, my old\\r\\nkeeper Horatio, who no sooner beheld me than he changed colour, but had\\r\\npresence of mind to advance and salute me, bidding me (with a low\\r\\nvoice) be under no apprehension, for he would not expose me. In spite\\r\\nof his assurance, I could not recover myself so far as to entertain\\r\\nthem, but withdrew to my chamber on pretence of a severe headache, to\\r\\nthe no small concern of my adorer, who took his leave in the tenderest\\r\\nmanner, and went off with his friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Having imparted my situation to my companion, she found it high time\\r\\nfor us to decamp, and that without any noise, because we were not only\\r\\nindebted to our landlady, but also to several tradesmen in the\\r\\nneighbourhood. Our retreat, therefore, was concerted and executed in\\r\\nthis manner: Having packed up all our clothes and moveables in small\\r\\nparcels, she (on pretence of fetching cordials for me) carried them at\\r\\nseveral times to the house of an acquaintance, where she likewise\\r\\nprocured a lodging, to which we retired in the middle of the night,\\r\\nwhen every other body in the house was asleep. I was now obliged to aim\\r\\nat lower game, and accordingly spread my nets among tradespeople, but\\r\\nfound them all too phlegmatic or cautious for my art and attractions,\\r\\ntill at last I became acquainted with you, on whom I practised all my\\r\\ndexterity; not that I believed you had any fortune, or expectation of\\r\\nme, but that I might transfer the burden of such debts as I had\\r\\nincurred, or should contract, from myself to another, and at the same\\r\\ntime avenge myself of your sex, by rendering miserable one who bore\\r\\nsuch resemblance to the wretch who ruined me; but Heaven preserved you\\r\\nfrom my snares by the discovery you made, which was owing to the\\r\\nnegligence of my maid in leaving the chamber-door unlocked when she\\r\\nwent to buy sugar for breakfast. When I found myself detected and\\r\\nforsaken by you, I was fain to move my lodging, and dwell two pair of\\r\\nstairs higher than before. My companion, being disappointed in her\\r\\nexpectations, left me, and I had no other resource than to venture\\r\\nforth, like the owls in the dark, to pick up a precarious and\\r\\nuncomfortable subsistence. I have often sauntered between Ludgate Hill\\r\\nand Charing Cross a whole winter night, exposed not only to the\\r\\ninclemency of the weather, but likewise to the rage of hunger and\\r\\nthirst, without being so happy as to meet with one dupe, then creep up\\r\\nto my garret, in a deplorable draggled condition, sneak to bed, and try\\r\\nto bury my appetite and sorrows in sleep. When I lighted on some rake\\r\\nor tradesman reeling home drunk, I frequently suffered the most brutal\\r\\ntreatment, in spite of which I was obliged to affect gaiety and good\\r\\nhumour, though my soul was stung with resentment and disdain, and my\\r\\nheart loaded with grief and affliction. In the course of these\\r\\nnocturnal adventures, I was infected with the disease, that in a short\\r\\ntime rendered me the object of my own abhorrence, and drove me to the\\r\\nretreat where your benevolence rescued me from the jaws of death.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\nSo much candour and good sense appeared in this ladyâ\\x80\\x99s narration, that\\r\\nI made no scruple of believing every syllable of what she said, and\\r\\nexpressed my astonishment at the variety of miseries she had undergone\\r\\nin so little time, for all her misfortunes had happened within the\\r\\ncompass of two years; I compared her situation with my own, and found\\r\\nit a thousand times more wretched. I had endured hardships, â\\x80\\x99tis\\r\\ntrueâ\\x80\\x94my whole life had been a series of such; and when I looked\\r\\nforward, the prospect was not much bettered, but then they were become\\r\\nhabitual to me, and consequently I could bear them with less\\r\\ndifficulty. If one scheme of life should not succeed, I could have\\r\\nrecourse to another, and so to a third, veering about to a thousand\\r\\ndifferent shifts, according to the emergencies of my fate, without\\r\\nforfeiting the dignity of my character beyond a power of retrieving it,\\r\\nor subjecting myself wholly to the caprice and barbarity of the world.\\r\\nOn the other hand, she had known and relished the sweets of prosperity,\\r\\nshe had been brought up under the wings of an indulgent parent, in all\\r\\nthe delicacies to which her sex and rank entitled her; and without any\\r\\nextravagance of hope, entertained herself with the view of\\r\\nuninterrupted happiness through the whole scene of life. How fatal\\r\\nthen, how tormenting, how intolerable, must her reverse of fortune\\r\\nbe!â\\x80\\x94a reverse, that not only robs her of these external comforts, and\\r\\nplunges her into all the miseries of want, but also murders her peace\\r\\nof mind, and entails upon her the curse of eternal infamy! Of all\\r\\nprofessions I pronounced that of a courtesan the most deplorable, and\\r\\nher of all courtesans the most unhappy. She allowed my observation to\\r\\nbe just in the main, but at the same time affirmed that notwithstanding\\r\\nthe disgraces which had fallen to her share, she had not been so\\r\\nunlucky in the condition of a prostitute as many others of the same\\r\\ncommunity. â\\x80\\x9cI have often seen,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cwhile I strolled about the\\r\\nstreets at midnight, a number of naked wretches reduced to rags and\\r\\nfilth, huddled together like swine, in the corner of a dark alley, some\\r\\nof whom, but eighteen months before, I had known the favourites of the\\r\\ntown, rolling in affluence, and glittering in all the pomp of equipage\\r\\nand dress. Miserable wretch that I am! perhaps the same horrors are\\r\\ndecreed for me!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo!â\\x80\\x9d cried she, after some pause, â\\x80\\x9cI shall never live\\r\\nto such extremity of distress; my own hand shall open a way for my\\r\\ndeliverance, before I arrive at that forlorn period!â\\x80\\x9d Her condition\\r\\nfilled me with sympathy and compassion: I revered her qualifications,\\r\\nlooked upon her as unfortunate, not criminal, and attended her with\\r\\nsuch care and success, that in less than two months her health, as well\\r\\nas my own, was perfectly re-established. As we often conferred upon our\\r\\nmutual affairs, and interchanged advice, a thousand different projects\\r\\nwere formed, which, upon further canvassing, appeared impracticable. We\\r\\nwould have gladly gone to service, but who would take us in without\\r\\nrecommendation? At length an expedient occurred to her, of which she\\r\\nintended to lay hold; and this was, to procure with the first money she\\r\\nshould earn, the homely garb of a country wench, go to some village at\\r\\na good distance from town, and come up in a waggon, as a fresh girl for\\r\\nservice: by which means she might be provided for, in a manner much\\r\\nmore suitable to her inclination than her present way of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI am reduced to a great miseryâ\\x80\\x94assaulted on Tower Hill by a press-gang,\\r\\nwho put me on board a tenderâ\\x80\\x94my usage thereâ\\x80\\x94my arrival on board at a\\r\\nman-of-war, where I am put in irons, and released by the good offices\\r\\nof Mr. Thompson, who recommends me as assistant to the surgeonâ\\x80\\x94-he\\r\\nrelates his own storyâ\\x80\\x94characters of the captain, surgeon, and first\\r\\nmate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI applauded the resolution of Miss Williams, who a few days after, was\\r\\nhired in quality of bar-keeper, by one of the ladies who had witnessed\\r\\nin her behalf at the Marshalsea, and who since that time had got credit\\r\\nwith a wine merchant, whose favourite she was, to set up a convenient\\r\\nhouse of her own. Thither my fellow-lodger repaired, after having taken\\r\\nleave of me with a torrent of tears, and a thousand protestations of\\r\\neternal gratitude; assuring me she would remain in this situation no\\r\\nlonger than she could pick up money sufficient to put her other design\\r\\nin execution.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for my own part, I saw no resource but the army or navy, between\\r\\nwhich I hesitated so long that I found myself reduced to a starving\\r\\ncondition. My spirit began to accommodate itself to my beggarly fate,\\r\\nand I became so mean as to go down towards Wapping, with an intention\\r\\nto inquire for an old schoolfellow, who, I understood, had got the\\r\\ncommand of a small coasting vessel then in the river, and implore his\\r\\nassistance. But my destiny prevented this abject piece of behaviour;\\r\\nfor as I crossed Tower Wharf, a squat tawny fellow with a hanger by his\\r\\nside, and a cudgel in his hand came up to me, calling, â\\x80\\x9cYo ho! brother,\\r\\nyou must come along with me.â\\x80\\x9d As I did not like his appearance, instead\\r\\nof answering his salutation, I quickened my pace, in hope of ridding\\r\\nmyself of his company; upon which he whistled aloud, and immediately\\r\\nanother sailor appeared before me, who laid hold of me by the collar,\\r\\nand began to drag me along. Not being in a humour to relish such\\r\\ntreatment, I disengaged myself of the assailant, and, with one blow of\\r\\nmy cudgel, laid him motionless on the ground; and perceiving myself\\r\\nsurrounded in a trice by ten or a dozen more, exerted myself with such\\r\\ndexterity and success, that some of my opponents were fain to attack me\\r\\nwith drawn cutlasses; and after an obstinate engagement, in which I\\r\\nreceived a large wound on my head, and another on my left cheek, I was\\r\\ndisarmed, taken prisoner, and carried on board a pressing tender,\\r\\nwhere, after being pinioned like a malefactor, I was thrust down into\\r\\nthe hold among a parcel of miserable wretches, the sight of whom well\\r\\nnigh distracted me. As the commanding officer had not humanity enough\\r\\nto order my wounds to be dressed, and I could not use my own hands, I\\r\\ndesired one of my fellow captives who was unfettered, to take a\\r\\nhandkerchief out of my pocket, and tie it round my head, to stop the\\r\\nbleeding. He pulled out my handkerchief, â\\x80\\x99tis true, but instead of\\r\\napplying it to the use for which I designed it, went to the grating of\\r\\nthe hatchway, and, with astonishing composure, sold it before my face\\r\\nto a bumboat woman (1) then on board, for a quart of gin, with which he\\r\\ntreated his companions, regardless of my circumstances and entreaties.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) A Bumboat woman is one who sells bread, cheese, greens, liquor, and\\r\\nfresh potatoes to the sailors, in a small boat that lies alongside the\\r\\nship\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI complained bitterly of this robbery to the midshipman on deck,\\r\\ntelling him at the same time, that unless my hurts were dressed, I\\r\\nshould bleed to death. But compassion was a weakness of which no man\\r\\ncould justly accuse this person, who, squirting a mouthful of dissolved\\r\\ntobacco upon me through the gratings, told me â\\x80\\x9cI was a mutinous dog,\\r\\nand that I might die for anything he cared!â\\x80\\x9d Finding there was no other\\r\\nremedy, I appealed to patience, and laid up this usage in my memory, to\\r\\nbe called at a more fitting opportunity. In the meantime, loss of\\r\\nblood, vexation, and want of food, contributed, with the noisome stench\\r\\nof the place, to throw me into a swoon, out of which I was recovered by\\r\\na tweak of the nose, administered by the tar who stood sentinel over\\r\\nus, who at the same time regaled me with a draught of flip, and\\r\\ncomforted me with the hopes of being put on board of the Thunder next\\r\\nday, where I should be freed of my handcuffs, and cured of my wounds by\\r\\nthe doctor. I no sooner heard him name the Thunder, than I asked if he\\r\\nhad belonged to that ship long; and be giving me to understand he had\\r\\nbelonged to her five years, I inquired if he knew Lieutenant Bowling?\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKnow Lieutenant Bowling!â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cOdds my life! and that I do; and a\\r\\ngood seaman he is as ever stepped upon forecastle, and a brave fellow\\r\\nas ever cracked biscuitâ\\x80\\x94none of your Guinea pigs, nor your fresh water,\\r\\nwish-washy, fair-weather fowls. Many a taut gale of wind have honest\\r\\nTom Bowling and I weathered together. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s his health, with all my\\r\\nheart: wherever he is, a-loft, or a-low, the lieutenant needs not be\\r\\nashamed to show himself.â\\x80\\x9d I was so much affected with this eulogium,\\r\\nthat I could not refrain from telling him that I was Lieutenant\\r\\nBowlingâ\\x80\\x99s kinsman; in consequence of which connection, he expressed his\\r\\ninclination to serve me, and when he was relieved, brought some cold\\r\\nboiled beef in a platter, and biscuit, on which we supped plentifully,\\r\\nand afterwards drank another can of flip together. While we were thus\\r\\nengaged, he recounted a great many exploits of my uncle, who, I found,\\r\\nwas very much beloved by the shipâ\\x80\\x99s company, and pitied for the\\r\\nmisfortune that had happened to him in Hispaniola, which I was very\\r\\nglad to be informed was not so great as I imagined; for Captain Oakum\\r\\nhad recovered of his wounds, and actually at that time commanded the\\r\\nship. Having by accident, in my pocket, my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s letter, written from\\r\\nPort Louis, I gave it my benefactor (whose name was Jack Rattlin) for\\r\\nhis perusal; but honest Jack told me frankly he could not read, and\\r\\ndesired to know the contents, which I immediately communicated. When he\\r\\nheard that part of it in which he says he had written to his landlord\\r\\nin Deal, he cried, â\\x80\\x9cBody oâ\\x80\\x99 me! that was old Ben Block; he was dead\\r\\nbefore the letter came to hand. Ey, ey, had Ben been alive, Lieutenant\\r\\nBowling would have had no occasion to skulk so long. Honest Ben was the\\r\\nfirst man that taught him to hand, reef, and steer. Well, well, we must\\r\\nall die, thatâ\\x80\\x99s certainâ\\x80\\x94we must all come to port sooner or later, at\\r\\nsea or on shoreâ\\x80\\x94we must be fast moored one day: deathâ\\x80\\x99s like the best\\r\\nbower anchor, as the saying isâ\\x80\\x94it will bring us all up.â\\x80\\x9d I could not\\r\\nbut signify my approbation of the justness of Jackâ\\x80\\x99s reflections, and\\r\\ninquired into the occasion of the quarrel between Captain Oakum and my\\r\\nuncle, which he explained in this manner: â\\x80\\x9cCaptain Oakum, to be sure,\\r\\nis a good man enoughâ\\x80\\x94besides, heâ\\x80\\x99s my commander; but whatâ\\x80\\x99s that to me?\\r\\nI do my duty, and value no manâ\\x80\\x99s anger of a ropeâ\\x80\\x99s end. Now the report\\r\\ngoes, as how heâ\\x80\\x99s a lord, or baron knightâ\\x80\\x99s brother, whereby (dâ\\x80\\x99ye see\\r\\nme,) he carries a straight arm, and keeps aloof from his officers,\\r\\nthough mayhap they may be as good men in the main as he. Now we lying\\r\\nat anchor in Tuberon Bay, Lieutenant Bowling had the middle watch, and\\r\\nas he always kept a good look out, he made (dâ\\x80\\x99ye see) three lights in\\r\\nthe offing, whereby he ran down to the great cabin for orders, and\\r\\nfound the captain asleep; whereupon he waked him, which put him in a\\r\\nmain high passion, and he swore woundily at the lieutenant, and called\\r\\nhim lousy Scotch son of a whore (for, I being then sentinel in the\\r\\nsteerage, heard all), and swab, and lubber, whereby the lieutenant\\r\\nreturned the salute, and they jawed together fore and aft a good spell,\\r\\ntill at last the captain turned out, and, laying hold of a rattan, came\\r\\nathwart Mr. Bowlingâ\\x80\\x99s quarter: whereby he told the captain that, if he\\r\\nwas not his commander, he would heave him overboard, and demanded\\r\\nsatisfaction ashore; whereby in the morning watch, the captain went\\r\\nashore in the pinnace, and afterwards the lieutenant carried the cutter\\r\\nashore, and so they, leaving the boatsâ\\x80\\x99 crews on their oars, went away\\r\\ntogether; and so (dâ\\x80\\x99ye see) in less than a quarter of an hour we heard\\r\\nfiring, whereby we made for the place, and found the captain lying\\r\\nwounded on the beach, and so brought him on board to the doctor, who\\r\\ncured him in less than six weeks. But the lieutenant clapped on all the\\r\\nsail he could bear, and had got far enough ahead before we knew\\r\\nanything of the matter; so that we could never after get sight of him,\\r\\nfor which we were not sorry, because the captain was mainly wrath, and\\r\\nwould certainly have done him a mischief; for he afterwards caused him\\r\\nto be run on the shipâ\\x80\\x99s books, whereby he lost all his pay, and, if he\\r\\nshould be taken, would be tried as a deserter.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis account of the captainâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour gave me no advantageous idea of\\r\\nhis character; and I could not help lamenting my own fate, that had\\r\\nsubjected me to such a commander. However, making a virtue of\\r\\nnecessity, I put a good face on the matter, and next day, was, with the\\r\\nother pressed men, put on board of the â\\x80\\x9cThunder,â\\x80\\x9d lying at the Nore.\\r\\nWhen we came alongside, the mate, who guarded us thither, ordered my\\r\\nhandcuffs to be taken off, that I might get on board the easier; this\\r\\ncircumstance being perceived by some of the company who stood upon the\\r\\ngangboard to see us enter, one of them called to Jack Rattlin, who was\\r\\nbusied in doing this friendly office for me, â\\x80\\x9cHey, Jack, what Newgate\\r\\ngalley have you boarded in the river as you came along? Have we not\\r\\nthieves enow among us already?â\\x80\\x9d Another, observing my wounds, which\\r\\nremained exposed to the air, told me, my seams were uncaulked, and that\\r\\nI must be new payed. A third, seeing my hair clotted together with\\r\\nblood, as it were into distinct cords, took notice, that my bows were\\r\\nmended with the red ropes, instead of my side. A fourth asked me, if I\\r\\ncould not keep my yards square without iron braces? And, in short, a\\r\\nthousand witticisms of the same nature were passed upon me before I\\r\\ncould get up the shipâ\\x80\\x99s side.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter we had been all entered upon the shipâ\\x80\\x99s books, I inquired of one\\r\\nof my shipmates where the surgeon was, that I might have my wounds\\r\\ndressed, and had actually got as far as the middle deck (for our ship\\r\\ncarried eighty guns), in my way to the cockpit, when I was met by the\\r\\nsame midshipman who had used me so barbarously in the tender: he,\\r\\nseeing me free from my chains, asked, with an insolent air, who had\\r\\nreleased me? To this question, I foolishly answered, with a countenance\\r\\nthat too plainly declared the state of my thoughts, â\\x80\\x9cWhoever did it, I\\r\\nam persuaded did not consult you in the affair.â\\x80\\x9d I had no sooner\\r\\nuttered these words, than he cried, â\\x80\\x9cDamn you, you saucy son of a\\r\\nhitch, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll teach you to talk so to your officer.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he\\r\\nbestowed on me several severe stripes with a supple jack he had in his\\r\\nhand: and, going to the commanding officer, made such a report of me,\\r\\nthat I was immediately put in irons by the master-at-arms, and a\\r\\nsentinel placed over me. Honest Rattlin, as soon as he heard of my\\r\\ncondition, came to me, and administered all the consolation he could,\\r\\nand then went to the surgeon in my behalf, who sent one of his mates to\\r\\ndress my wounds. This mate was no other than my old friend Thompson,\\r\\nwith whom I became acquainted at the Navy Office, as before mentioned.\\r\\nIf I knew him at first sight, it was not easy for him to recognise me,\\r\\ndisfigured with blood and dirt, and altered by the misery I had\\r\\nundergone. Unknown as I was to him, he surveyed me with looks of\\r\\ncompassion, and handled my sores with great tenderness. When he had\\r\\napplied what he thought proper, and was about to leave me, I asked him\\r\\nif my misfortunes had disguised me so much that he could not recollect\\r\\nmy face? Upon this address he observed me with great earnestness for\\r\\nsome time, and at length protested he could not recollect one feature\\r\\nof my countenance. To keep him no longer in suspense, I told him my\\r\\nname, which when he heard, he embraced me with affection, and professed\\r\\nhis sorrow at seeing me in such a disagreeable situation. I made him\\r\\nacquainted with my story, and, when he heard how inhumanly I had been\\r\\nused in the tender, he left me abruptly, assuring me I should see him\\r\\nagain soon. I had scarce time to wonder at his sudden departure, when\\r\\nthe master-at-arms came to the place of my confinement, and bade me\\r\\nfollow him to the quarter-deck, where I was examined by the first\\r\\nlieutenant, who commanded the ship in the absence of the captain,\\r\\ntouching the treatment I had received in the tender from my friend the\\r\\nmidshipman, who was present to confront me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recounted the particulars of his behaviour to me, not only in the\\r\\ntender, but since my being on board the ship, part of which being\\r\\nproved by the evidence of Jack Rattlin and others, who had no great\\r\\ndevotion for my oppressor, I was discharged from confinement, to make\\r\\nway for him, who was delivered to the master-at-arms to take his turn\\r\\nin the bilboes. And this was not the only satisfaction I enjoyed, for I\\r\\nwas, at the request of the surgeon, exempted from all other duty than\\r\\nthat of assisting his mates, in making and administering medicines to\\r\\nthe sick. This good office I owed to the friendship of Mr. Thompson,\\r\\nwho had represented me in such a favourable light to the surgeon, that\\r\\nhe demanded me of the lieutenant to supply the place of his third mate,\\r\\nwho was lately dead. When I had obtained this favour, my friend\\r\\nThompson carried me down to the cockpit, which is the place allotted\\r\\nfor the habitation of the surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s mates; and when he had shown me\\r\\ntheir berth (as he called it), I was filled with astonishment and\\r\\nhorror, We descended by divers ladders to a space as dark as a dungeon,\\r\\nwhich, I understood, was immersed several feet under water, being\\r\\nimmediately above the hold. I had no sooner approached this dismal\\r\\ngulph, than my nose was saluted with an intolerable stench of putrified\\r\\ncheese and rancid butter, that issued from an apartment at the foot of\\r\\nthe ladder, resembling a chandlerâ\\x80\\x99s shop, where, by the faint\\r\\nglimmering of a candle, I could perceive a man with a pale, meagre\\r\\ncountenance, sitting behind a kind of desk, having spectacles on his\\r\\nnose, and a pen in his hand. This (I learned of Mr. Thompson) was the\\r\\nshipâ\\x80\\x99s steward, who sat there to distribute provision to the several\\r\\nmesses, and to mark what each received. He therefore presented my name\\r\\nto him, and desired I might be entered in his mess; then, taking a\\r\\nlight in his hand, conducted me to the place of his residence, which\\r\\nwas a square of about six feet, surrounded with the medicine-chest,\\r\\nthat of the first mate, his own, and a board by way of table fastened\\r\\nto the after powder room; it was also inclosed with canvas nailed round\\r\\nto the beams of the ship, to screen us from the cold, as well as from\\r\\nthe view of the midshipmen and quartermaster, who lodged within the\\r\\ncable-tiers on each side of us. In this gloomy mansion he entertained\\r\\nme with some cold suit pork, which he brought from a sort of locker,\\r\\nfixed above the table: and calling for the boy of the mess, sent for a\\r\\ncan of beer, of which he made excellent flip to crown the banquet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time I began to recover my spirits, which had been exceedingly\\r\\ndepressed with the appearance of everything about me, and could no\\r\\nlonger refrain from asking the particulars of Mr. Thompsonâ\\x80\\x99s fortune\\r\\nsince I had seen him in London. He told me, that being disappointed in\\r\\nhis expectations of borrowing money to gratify the rapacious sâ\\x80\\x94tâ\\x80\\x94ry at\\r\\nthe Navy Office, he found himself utterly unable to subsist any longer\\r\\nin town, and had actually offered his service, in quality of mate, to\\r\\nthe surgeon of a merchant ship, bound to Guinea on the slaving trade;\\r\\nwhen, one morning, a young fellow, of whom he had some acquaintance,\\r\\ncame to his lodgings, and informed him that he had seen a warrant made\\r\\nout in his name at the Navy Office, for surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s second mate of a\\r\\nthird-rate. This unexpected piece of good news he could scarcely\\r\\nbelieve to be true, more especially as he had been found qualified at\\r\\nSurgeonsâ\\x80\\x99 Hall for third mate only; but that he might not be wanting to\\r\\nhimself, he went thither to be assured, and actually found it so:\\r\\nwhereupon, demanding his warrant, it was delivered to him, and the\\r\\noaths administered immediately. That very afternoon he went to\\r\\nGravesend in the tilt-boat, from whence he took place in the tide-coach\\r\\nfor Rochester; next morning got on board the â\\x80\\x9cThunder,â\\x80\\x9d for which he\\r\\nwas appointed, then lying in the harbour at Chatham; and the same day\\r\\nwas mustered by the clerk of the checque. And well it was for him that\\r\\nsuch expedition was used; for, in less than twelve hours after his\\r\\narrival, another William Thompson came on board, affirming that he was\\r\\nthe person for whom the warrant was expedited, and that the other was\\r\\nan impostor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend was grievously alarmed at this accident, the more so, as his\\r\\nnamesake had very much the advantage over him both in assurance and\\r\\ndress. However, to acquit himself of the suspicion of imposture, he\\r\\nproduced several letters written from Scotland to him in that name,\\r\\nand, recollecting that his indentures were in a box on board, he\\r\\nbrought them up, and convinced all present that he had not assumed a\\r\\nname which did not belong to him. His competitor, enraged that they\\r\\nshould hesitate in doing him justice (for to be sure the warrant had\\r\\nbeen designed for him), behaved with so much indecent heat, that the\\r\\ncommanding officer (who was the same gentleman I had seen) and the\\r\\nsurgeon were offended at his presumption, and making a point of it with\\r\\ntheir friends in town, in less than a week got the first confirmed in\\r\\nhis station. â\\x80\\x9cI have been on board,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cever since; and, as this\\r\\nway of life is becoming familiar to me, have no cause to complain of my\\r\\nsituation. The surgeon is a good-natured, indolent man; the first mate\\r\\n(who is now on shore on duty) is indeed a little proud and choleric, as\\r\\nall Welshmen are, but in the main a friendly honest fellow. The\\r\\nlieutenants I have no concern with; and, as for the captain, he is too\\r\\nmuch of a gentleman to know a surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s mate, even by sight.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe behaviour of Mr. Morganâ\\x80\\x94his pride, displeasure, and generosityâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\neconomy of our mess describedâ\\x80\\x94Thomsonâ\\x80\\x99s further friendshipâ\\x80\\x94the nature\\r\\nof my duty explainedâ\\x80\\x94the situation of the sick\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was thus discoursing to me, we heard a voice on the cockpit\\r\\nladder pronounce with great vehemence, in a strange dialect, â\\x80\\x9cThe devil\\r\\nand his dam blow me from the top of Monchdenny, if I go to him before\\r\\nthere is something in my pelly. Let his nose be as yellow as saffron,\\r\\nor as plue as a pell (look you), or as green as a leek, â\\x80\\x99tis all one.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nTo this declaration somebody answered, â\\x80\\x9cSo it seems my poor messmate\\r\\nmust part his cable for want of a little assistance. His foretopsail is\\r\\nloose already; and besides the doctor ordered you to overhaul him; but\\r\\nI see you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind what your master says.â\\x80\\x9d Here he was interrupted\\r\\nwith, â\\x80\\x9cSplutter and cons! you lousy tog, who do you call my master? Get\\r\\nyou gone to the doctor, and tell him my birth, and education, and my\\r\\nabilities; and moreover, my behaviour is as good as his, or any\\r\\nshentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s (no disparagement to him,) in the whole world. Cot pless\\r\\nmy soul I does he think, or conceive, or imagine, that I am a horse, or\\r\\nan ass, or a goat, to trudge backwards and forwards, and upwards and\\r\\ndownwards, and by sea and by land; at his will and pleasure? Go your\\r\\nways, you rapscallion, and tell Doctor Atkins that I desire and request\\r\\nthat he will give a look upon the tying man, and order something for\\r\\nhim, if he be dead or alive, and I will see him take it by and by, when\\r\\nmy craving stomach is satisfied, look you.â\\x80\\x9d At this, the other went\\r\\naway, saying, â\\x80\\x9cthat if they should serve him so when he was dying, by\\r\\nGod he would be foul of them in the other world.â\\x80\\x9d Here Mr. Thompson let\\r\\nme know, that the person we heard was Mr. Morgan, the first mate, who\\r\\nwas just come on board from the hospital, whither he had attended some\\r\\nof the sick in the morning; at the same time I saw him come into the\\r\\nberth. He was a short thick man, with a face garnished with pimples, a\\r\\nsnub nose turned up at the end, an excessive wide mouth, and little\\r\\nfiery eyes, surrounded with skin puckered up in innumerable wrinkles.\\r\\nMy friend immediately made him acquainted with my case; when he\\r\\nregarded me with a very lofty look, but without speaking, set down a\\r\\nbundle he had in his hand, and approached the cupboard, which, when he\\r\\nhad opened, he exclaimed in a great passion, â\\x80\\x9cCot is my life, all the\\r\\npork is gone, as I am a Christian!â\\x80\\x9d Thompson then gave him to\\r\\nunderstand, that, as I had been brought on board half famished, he\\r\\ncould do no less than to entertain me with what was in the locker, and\\r\\nthe rather as he had bid the steward enter me in the mess. Whether this\\r\\ndisappointment made Mr. Morgan more peevish than usual, or he really\\r\\nthought himself too little regarded by his fellow mate, I know not, but\\r\\nafter some pause, he went on in this manner: â\\x80\\x9cMr. Thompson, perhaps you\\r\\ndo not use me with all the good manners, and complaisance, and respect\\r\\n(look you,) that becomes you, because you have not vouchsafed to advise\\r\\nwith me in this affair. I have in my time (look you,) been a man of\\r\\nsome weight, and substance, and consideration, and have kept house and\\r\\nhome, and paid scot and lot, and the kingâ\\x80\\x99s taxes; ay, and maintained a\\r\\nfamily to boot. And moreover, also, I am your senior, and your older,\\r\\nand your petter, Mr. Thompson.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMy elder, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll allow you to be, but\\r\\nnot my better!â\\x80\\x9d cried Thompson, with some heat. â\\x80\\x9cCot is my Saviour, and\\r\\nwitness too,â\\x80\\x9d said Morgan, with great vehemence, â\\x80\\x9cthat I am more elder,\\r\\nand therefore more petter by many years than you.â\\x80\\x9d Fearing this dispute\\r\\nmight be attended with some bad consequence, I interposed, and told Mr.\\r\\nMorgan I was very sorry for having been the occasion of any difference\\r\\nbetween him and the second mate; and that, rather than cause the least\\r\\nbreach in their good understanding, I would eat my allowance to myself,\\r\\nor seek admission into some other company. But Thompson, with more\\r\\nspirit than discretion (as I thought), insisted upon my remaining where\\r\\nhe had appointed me; and observed that no man, possessed of generosity\\r\\nand compassion, would have any objection to it, considering my birth\\r\\nand talents, and the misfortunes I had of late so unjustly undergone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was touching Mr. Morgan on the right key, who protested with great\\r\\nearnestness, that he had no objection to my being received in the mess;\\r\\nbut only complained that the ceremony of asking his consent was not\\r\\nobserved. â\\x80\\x9cAs for a sheltenman in distress,â\\x80\\x9d said he, shaking me by the\\r\\nhand, â\\x80\\x9cI lofe him as I lofe my own powels: for, Cot help me! I have had\\r\\nvexations enough upon my own pack.â\\x80\\x9d And as I afterwards learned, in so\\r\\nsaying, he spoke no more than what was true; for he had been once\\r\\nsettled in a very good situation in Glamorganshire, and was ruined by\\r\\nbeing security for an acquaintance. All differences being composed, he\\r\\nuntied his bundle, which consisted of three bunches of onions, and a\\r\\ngreat lump of Cheshire cheese, wrapped up in a handkerchief: and,\\r\\ntaking some biscuit from the cupboard, fell to with a keen appetite,\\r\\ninviting us to share of the repast. When he had fed heartily on his\\r\\nhomely fare, he filled a large cup, made of a cocoa-nut shell, with\\r\\nbrandy, and, drinking it off, told us, â\\x80\\x9cPrandy was the best menstruum\\r\\nfor onions and sheese.â\\x80\\x9d His hunger being appeased, he began to be in\\r\\nbetter humour; and, being inquisitive about my birth, no sooner\\r\\nunderstood that I was descended of a good family, than he discovered a\\r\\nparticular good-will to me on that account, deducing his own pedigree\\r\\nin a direct line from the famous Caractacus, king of the Britons, who\\r\\nwas first the prisoner, and afterwards the friend of Claudius Caesar.\\r\\nPerceiving how much I was reduced in point of linen, he made me a\\r\\npresent of two good ruffled shirts, which, with two more of check which\\r\\nI received from Mr. Thompson, enabled me to appear with decency.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the sailor, whom Mr. Morgan had sent to the doctor, brought a\\r\\nprescription for his messmate, which when the Welshman had read, he got\\r\\nup to prepare it, and asked, â\\x80\\x9cif the man was dead or alive.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDead!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nreplied Jack; â\\x80\\x9cif he was dead, he would have no occasion for doctorâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nstuff. No, thank God, death hanâ\\x80\\x99t as yet boarded him. But they have\\r\\nbeen yard-arm and yard-arm these three glasses.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAre his eyes open,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncontinued the mate. â\\x80\\x9cHis starboard eye,â\\x80\\x9d said the sailor, â\\x80\\x9cis open, but\\r\\nfast jammed in his head: and the haulyards of his under jaw have given\\r\\nway.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPassion of my heart!â\\x80\\x9d cried Morgan, â\\x80\\x9cthe man is as pad as one\\r\\nwould desire to be! Did you feel his pulses!â\\x80\\x9d To this the other replied\\r\\nwith â\\x80\\x9cAnan!â\\x80\\x9d Upon which this Cambro Briton, with great earnestness and\\r\\nhumanity, ordered the tar to run to his messmate, and keep him alive\\r\\ntill he should come with the medicine, â\\x80\\x9cand then,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cyou shall\\r\\nperadventure pehold what you shall see.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor fellow, with great simplicity, ran to the place where the sick\\r\\nman lay, but in less than a minute returned with a woful countenance,\\r\\nand told us his comrade had struck. Morgan, hearing this, exclaimed,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMercy upon my salvation! why did you not stop him till I came?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cStop\\r\\nhim!â\\x80\\x9d said the other; â\\x80\\x9cI hailed him several times, but he was too far\\r\\non his way, and the enemy had got possession of his close quarters; so\\r\\nthat he did not mind me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell, well,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cwe all owe heaven a\\r\\nteath. Go your ways, you ragamuffin, and take an example and a warning,\\r\\nlook you, and repent of your misteets.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he pushed the seaman\\r\\nout of the berth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we entertained us with reflections suitable to this event, we\\r\\nheard the boatswain pipe to dinner; and immediately the boy belonging\\r\\nto our mess ran to the locker, from whence he carried off a large\\r\\nwooden platter, and, in a few minutes, returned with it full of boiled\\r\\npeas, crying â\\x80\\x9cScaldingsâ\\x80\\x9d all the way as he came. The cloth, consisting\\r\\nof a piece of an old sail, was instantly laid, covered with three\\r\\nplates, which by the colour I could with difficulty discern to be\\r\\nmetal, and as many spoons of the same composition, two of which were\\r\\ncurtailed in the handles, and the other abridged in the lip. Mr. Morgan\\r\\nhimself enriched this mess with a lump of salt butter scooped from an\\r\\nold gallipot, and a handful of onions shorn, with some pounded pepper.\\r\\nI was not very much tempted with the appearance of this dish, of which,\\r\\nnevertheless, my messmates ate heartily, advising me to follow their\\r\\nexample, as it was banyan day and we could have no meat till next noon.\\r\\nBut I had already laid in sufficient for the occasion, and therefore\\r\\ndesired to be excused: expressing a curiosity to know the meaning of\\r\\nbanyan day. They told me, that, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,\\r\\nthe shipâ\\x80\\x99s company had no allowance of meat, and that these meagre days\\r\\nwere called banyan days, the reason of which they did not know; but I\\r\\nhave since learned they take their denomination from a sect of devotees\\r\\nin some parts of the East Indies, who never taste flesh.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner Thompson led me round the ship, showed me the different\\r\\nparts, described their uses, and, as far as he could, made me\\r\\nacquainted with the particulars of the discipline and economy practised\\r\\non board. He then demanded of the boatswain a hammock for me, which was\\r\\nslung in a very neat manner by my friend Jack Rattlin; and, as I had no\\r\\nbed-clothes, procured credit for me with the purser, for a mattress and\\r\\ntwo blankets. At seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the evening Morgan visited the sick,\\r\\nand, having ordered what was proper for each, I assisted Thompson in\\r\\nmaking up his prescriptions: but when I followed him with the medicines\\r\\ninto the sick berth, or hospital, and observed the situation of the\\r\\npatients, I was much less surprised that people should die on board,\\r\\nthan that a sick person should recover. Here I saw about fifty\\r\\nmiserable distempered wretches, suspended in rows, so huddled one upon\\r\\nanother, that not more than fourteen inches space was allotted for each\\r\\nwith his bed and bedding; and deprived of the light of the day, as well\\r\\nas of fresh air; breathing nothing but a noisome atmosphere of the\\r\\nmorbid steams exhaling from their own excrements and diseased bodies,\\r\\ndevoured with vermin hatched in the filth that surrounded them, and\\r\\ndestitute of every convenience necessary for people in that helpless\\r\\ncondition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA disagreeable accident happens to me in the discharge of my\\r\\nofficeâ\\x80\\x94Morganâ\\x80\\x99s nose is offendedâ\\x80\\x94a dialogue between him and the Shipâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nstewardâ\\x80\\x94upon examination, I find more causes of complaint than oneâ\\x80\\x94my\\r\\nhair is cut offâ\\x80\\x94Morganâ\\x80\\x99s cookeryâ\\x80\\x94the manner of sleeping on boardâ\\x80\\x94I am\\r\\nwaked in the night by a dreadful noise\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCould not comprehend how it was possible for the attendants to come\\r\\nnear those who hung on the inside towards the sides of the ship, in\\r\\norder to assist them, as they seemed barricadoed by those who lay on\\r\\nthe outside, and entirely out of the reach of all visitation; much less\\r\\ncould I conceive how my friend Thompson would be able to administer\\r\\nclysters, that were ordered for some, in that situation; when I saw him\\r\\nthrust his wig in his pocket, and strip himself to his waistcoat in a\\r\\nmoment, then creep on all fours under the hammocks of the sick, and,\\r\\nforcing up his bare pate between two, keep them asunder with one\\r\\nshoulder, until he had done his duty. Eager to learn the service, I\\r\\ndesired he would give me leave to perform the next operation of that\\r\\nkind; and he consenting, I undressed myself after his example, and\\r\\ncrawling along, the ship happened to roll: this motion alarming me, I\\r\\nlaid hold of the first thing that came within my grasp with such\\r\\nviolence, that I overturned it, and soon found, by the smell that\\r\\nissued upon me, that I had unlocked a box of the most delicious\\r\\nperfume. It was well for me that my nose was none of the most delicate,\\r\\nelse I know not how I might have been affected by this vapour, which\\r\\ndiffused itself all over the ship, to the utter discomposure of\\r\\neverybody who tarried on the same dock! neither was the consequence of\\r\\nthis disgrace confined to my sense of smelling only; for I felt my\\r\\nmisfortune more ways than one. That I might not, however, appear\\r\\naltogether disconcerted in this my first essay, I got up, and, pushing\\r\\nmy head with great force between two hammocks, towards the middle,\\r\\nwhere the greatest resistance was, I made an opening indeed, but, not\\r\\nunderstanding the knack of dexterously turning my shoulder to maintain\\r\\nmy advantage, had the mortification to find myself stuck up, as it\\r\\nwere, in a pillory, and the weight of three or four people bearing on\\r\\neach side of my neck, so that I was in danger of strangulation. While I\\r\\nremained in this defenceless posture, one of the sick men, rendered\\r\\npeevish by his distemper, was so enraged at the smell I had occasioned\\r\\nand the rude shock he had received from me in my elevation, that, with\\r\\nmany bitter reproaches, he seized me by the nose, which he tweaked so\\r\\nunmercifully, that I roared with anguish. Thompson, perceiving my\\r\\ncondition, ordered one of the waiters to my assistance, who, with much\\r\\ndifficulty, disengaged me from this situation, and hindered me from\\r\\ntaking vengeance on the sick man, whose indisposition would not have\\r\\nscreened him from the effects of my indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having made an end of our ministry for that time, we descended to\\r\\nthe cockpit, my friend comforting me for what had happened with a\\r\\nhomely proverb, which I do not choose to repeat. When we had descended\\r\\nhalf-way down the ladder, Mr. Morgan, before he saw us, having\\r\\nintelligence by his nose of the approach of something extraordinary,\\r\\ncried, â\\x80\\x9cCot have mercy upon my senses! I pelieve the enemy has poarded\\r\\nus in a stinkpot!â\\x80\\x9d Then, directing his discourse to the steward, from\\r\\nwhence he imagined the odour proceeded, he reprimanded him severely for\\r\\nthe freedoms he took among gentlemen of birth, and threatened to smoke\\r\\nhim like a padger with sulphur, if ever he should presume to offend his\\r\\nneighbours with such smells for the future. The steward, conscious of\\r\\nhis own innocence, replied with some warmth, â\\x80\\x9cI know of no smells but\\r\\nthose of your own making.â\\x80\\x9d This repartee introduced a smart dialogue,\\r\\nin which the Welshman undertook to prove, that, though the stench he\\r\\ncomplained of did not flow from the stewardâ\\x80\\x99s own body, he was\\r\\nnevertheless the author of it, by serving out damaged provisions to the\\r\\nshipâ\\x80\\x99s company; and, in particular, putrified cheese, from the use of\\r\\nwhich only, he affirmed, such unsavoury steams could arise. Then he\\r\\nlaunched out into the praise of good cheese, of which he gave the\\r\\nanalysis; explained the different kinds of that commodity, with the\\r\\nmethods practised to make and preserve it, concluded in observing,\\r\\nthat, in yielding good cheese, the county of Glamorgan might vie with\\r\\nCheshire itself, and was much superior to it in the produce of goats\\r\\nand putter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI gathered from this conversation, that, if I entered in my present\\r\\npickle, I should be no welcome guest, and therefore desired Mr.\\r\\nThompson to go before, and represent my calamity; at which the first\\r\\nmate, expressing some concern, went upon deck immediately, taking his\\r\\nway through the cable-tier and the main hatchway, to avoid encountering\\r\\nme; desiring me to clean myself as soon as possible: for he intended to\\r\\nregale himself with a dish of salmagundy and a pipe. Accordingly, I set\\r\\nabout this disagreeable business, and soon found I had more causes of\\r\\ncomplaint than I at first imagined; for I perceived some guests had\\r\\nhonoured me with their company, whose visit I did not think seasonable:\\r\\nneither did they seem inclined to leave me in a hurry, for they were in\\r\\npossession of my chief quarters, where they fed without reserve at the\\r\\nexpense of my blood. But, considering it would be easier to extirpate\\r\\nthe ferocious colony in the infancy of their settlement, than after\\r\\nthey should be multiplied and naturalised to the soil, I took the\\r\\nadvice of my friend, who, to prevent such misfortunes, went always\\r\\nclose shaved, and made the boy of our mess cut off my hair, which had\\r\\nbeen growing since I left the service of Lavement; and the second mate\\r\\nlent me an old bobwig to supply the loss of that covering. This affair\\r\\nbeing ended, and everything adjusted in the best manner my\\r\\ncircumstances would permit, the descendant of Caractacus returned, and,\\r\\nordering the boy to bring a piece of salt beef from the brine, cut off\\r\\na slice, and mixed it with an equal quantity of onions, which seasoning\\r\\nwith a moderate proportion of pepper and salt, he brought it to a\\r\\nconsistence with oil and vinegar; then, tasting the dish, assured us it\\r\\nwas the best salmagundy that ever he made, and recommended it to our\\r\\npalate with such heartiness that I could not help doing honour to his\\r\\npreparation. But I had no sooner swallowed a mouthful, than I thought\\r\\nmy entrails were scorched, and endeavoured with a deluge of small-beer\\r\\nto allay the heat it occasioned. Supper being over, Mr. Morgan having\\r\\nsmoked a couple of pipes, and supplied the moisture he had expended\\r\\nwith as many cans of flip, of which we all partook, a certain yawning\\r\\nbegan to admonish me that it was high time to repair by sleep the\\r\\ninjury I had suffered from want of rest the preceding night; which\\r\\nbeing perceived by my companions, whose time of repose was now arrived,\\r\\nthey proposed we should turn in, or in other words, go to bed. Our\\r\\nhammocks, which hung parallel to one another, on the outside of the\\r\\nberth, were immediately unlashed, and I beheld my messmates spring with\\r\\ngreat agility into their respective nests, where they seemed to lie\\r\\nconcealed, very much at their ease. But it was some time before I could\\r\\nprevail upon myself to trust my carcase at such a distance from the\\r\\nground, in a narrow bag, out of which, I imagined, I should be apt, on\\r\\nthe least motion in my sleep, to tumble down at the hazard of breaking\\r\\nmy bones. I suffered myself, however, to be persuaded, and taking a\\r\\nleap to get in, threw myself quite over, with such violence, that had I\\r\\nnot luckily got hold of Thompsonâ\\x80\\x99s hammock, I should have pitched upon\\r\\nmy head on the other side, and in all likelihood fractured my skull.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some fruitless efforts, I succeeded at last; but the apprehension\\r\\nof the jeopardy in which I believed myself withstood all the attacks of\\r\\nsleep till towards the morning watch, when, in spite of my fears, I was\\r\\noverpowered with slumber, though I did not long enjoy this comfortable\\r\\nsituation, being aroused with a noise so loud and shrill, that I\\r\\nthought the drums of my ears were burst by it; this was followed by a\\r\\ndreadful summons pronounced by a hoarse voice, which I could not\\r\\nunderstand. While I was debating with myself, whether or not I should\\r\\nwake my companion and inquire into the occasion of this disturbance, I\\r\\nwas informed by one of the quartermasters who passed by me with a\\r\\nlantern in his hand, that the noise which alarmed me was occasioned by\\r\\nthe boatswainâ\\x80\\x99s mates who called up the larboard watch, and that I must\\r\\nlay my account with such an interruption every morning at the same\\r\\nhour. Being now more assured of my safety, I undressed myself again to\\r\\nrest, and slept till eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock, when rising, and breakfasting with\\r\\nmy comrades on biscuit and brandy, the sick were visited and assisted\\r\\nas before; after which visitation my good friend Thompson explained and\\r\\nperformed another piece of duty, to which I was a stranger. At a\\r\\ncertain hour in the morning, the boy of the mess went round all the\\r\\ndecks, ringing a small hand-bell, and, in rhymes composed for the\\r\\noccasion, invited all those who had sores to repair before the mast,\\r\\nwhere one of the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s mates attended, with applications to dress\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI acquire the friendship of the Surgeon, who procures a warrant for me,\\r\\nand makes me a present of clothesâ\\x80\\x94a battle between a Midshipman and\\r\\nmeâ\\x80\\x94the Surgeon leaves the shipâ\\x80\\x94the Captain comes on board with another\\r\\nSurgeonâ\\x80\\x94a dialogue between the Captain and Morganâ\\x80\\x94the sick are ordered\\r\\nto be brought upon the Quarter-deck and examinedâ\\x80\\x94the consequences of\\r\\nthat orderâ\\x80\\x94a Madman accuses Morgan, and is set at liberty by command of\\r\\nthe Captain, whom he instantly attacks, and pummels without mercy\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I was busied with my friend in the practice. The doctor chanced\\r\\nto pass by the place where we were, and stopping to observe me appeared\\r\\nvery well satisfied with my application; and afterwards sent for me to\\r\\nhis cabin, where, having examined me touching my skill in surgery, and\\r\\nthe particulars of my fortune, he interested himself so far in my\\r\\nbehalf, as to promise his assistance in procuring a warrant for me,\\r\\nseeing I had already been found qualified at Surgeonsâ\\x80\\x99 Hall for the\\r\\nstation I filled on board; and in this good office he the more\\r\\ncordially engaged when he understood I was nephew to lieutenant\\r\\nBowling, for whom he expressed a particular regard. In the meantime, I\\r\\ncould learn from his discourse that he did not intend to go to sea\\r\\nagain with Captain Oakum, having, as he thought, been indifferently\\r\\nused by him during the last voyage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I lived tolerably easy, in expectation of preferment, I was not\\r\\naltogether without mortifications, which I not only suffered from the\\r\\nrude insults of the sailors and petty officers, among whom I was known\\r\\nby the name of Loblolly Boy, but also from the disposition of Morgan,\\r\\nwho, though friendly in the main, was often very troublesome with his\\r\\npride, which expected a good deal of submission from me, and delighted\\r\\nin recapitulating the favours I had received at his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout six weeks after my arrival on board, the surgeon, bidding me to\\r\\nfollow him into his cabin, presented a warrant to me, by which I was\\r\\nappointed surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s third mate on board the Thunder. This he had\\r\\nprocured by his interest at the Navy Office; as also another for\\r\\nhimself, by virtue of which he was removed into a second-rate. I\\r\\nacknowledged his kindness in the strongest terms my gratitude could\\r\\nsuggest, and professed my sorrow at the prospect of losing so valuable\\r\\na friend, to whom I hoped to have recommended myself still further, by\\r\\nmy respectful and diligent behaviour. But his generosity rested not\\r\\nhere; for before he left the ship he made me a present of a chest and\\r\\nsome clothes that enabled me to support the rank to which he had raised\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found my spirit revive with my good fortune; and, now I was an\\r\\nofficer, resolved to maintain the dignity of my station, against all\\r\\nopposition or affronts; nor was it long before I had occasion to exert\\r\\nmy resolution. My old enemy, the midshipman (whose name was Crampley),\\r\\nentertaining an implacable animosity against me for the disgrace he had\\r\\nsuffered on my account, had since that time taken all opportunities of\\r\\nreviling and ridiculing me, when I was not entitled to retort this bad\\r\\nusage; and, even after I had been rated on the books, and mustered as\\r\\nsurgeonâ\\x80\\x99s mate, did not think fit to restrain his insolence. In\\r\\nparticular, being one day present while I dressed a wound in a sailorâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nleg, he began to sing a song, which I thought highly injurious to the\\r\\nhonour of my country, and therefore signified my resentment, by\\r\\nobserving that the Scots always laid their account with finding enemies\\r\\namong the ignorant, insignificant, and malicious. This unexpected piece\\r\\nof assurance enraged him to such a degree, that he lent me a blow on\\r\\nthe face, which I verily thought had demolished my cheek-bone. I was\\r\\nnot slow in returning the obligation, and the affair began to be very\\r\\nserious, when by accident Mr. Morgan, and one of the masterâ\\x80\\x99s mates,\\r\\ncoming that way, interposed, and, inquiring into the cause, endeavoured\\r\\nto promote a reconciliation; but, finding us both exasperated to the\\r\\nuttermost, and bent against accommodation, they advised us either to\\r\\nleave our difference undecided, till we should have an opportunity of\\r\\nterminating it on shore, like gentlemen, or else choose a proper place\\r\\non board, and bring it to an issue by boxing. The last expedient was\\r\\ngreedily embraced by us both; and, being forthwith conducted to the\\r\\nground proposed, we stripped in a moment, and began a furious contest,\\r\\nin which I soon found myself inferior to my antagonist, not so much in\\r\\nstrength and agility, as in skill, which he had acquired in the school\\r\\nof Hockley-in-the-Hole at Tottenham-court. Many cross buttocks did I\\r\\nsustain, and pegs on the stomach without number, till at last my breath\\r\\nbeing quite gone, as well as my vigour wasted, I grew desperate, and\\r\\ncollecting all my strength in one effort, threw in at once, head,\\r\\nhands, and feet, with such violence, that I drove my antagonist three\\r\\npaces backward into the main hatchway, down which he fell, and pitching\\r\\nupon his head and right shoulder, remained without sense and motion.\\r\\nMorgan, looking down, and seeing him lie in that condition, cried,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cUpon my conscience, as I am a Christian sinner, (look you,) I believe\\r\\nhis pattles are all ofer; but I take you all to witness that there was\\r\\nno treachery in the case, and that he has suffered by the chance of\\r\\nwar.â\\x80\\x9d So saying he descended to the deck below, to examine into the\\r\\nsituation of my adversary, and left me very little pleased with my\\r\\nvictory, as I found myself not only terribly bruised, but likewise in\\r\\ndanger of being called to account for the death of Crampley; but this\\r\\nfear vanished when my fellow-mate having, by bleeding him in the\\r\\njugular, brought him to himself, and inquired into the state of his\\r\\nbody, called up to me to be under no concern, for the midshipman had\\r\\nreceived no other damage than as pretty a luxation of the os humeri as\\r\\none would desire to see on a summerâ\\x80\\x99s day. Upon this information I\\r\\ncrawled down to the cock-pit, and acquainted Thompson with the affair,\\r\\nwho, providing himself with bandages, etc, necessary for the occasion,\\r\\nwent up to assist Mr. Morgan in the reduction of the dislocation. When\\r\\nthis was successfully performed, they wished me joy of the event of the\\r\\ncombat; and the Welshman, after observing, that, in all likelihood, the\\r\\nancient Scots and Britons were the same people, bade me â\\x80\\x9cpraise Cot for\\r\\nputting mettle in my pelly, and strength in my limbs to support it.â\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\nacquired such reputation by this rencontre, which lasted twenty\\r\\nminutes, that everybody became more cautious in behaviour towards me;\\r\\nthough Crampley, with his arm in a sling, talked very high, and\\r\\nthreatened to seize the first opportunity of retrieving on shore the\\r\\nhonour he had lost by an accident, from which I could justly claim no\\r\\nmerit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout this time, Captain Oakum, having received sailing orders, came on\\r\\nboard, and brought along with him a surgeon of his own country, who\\r\\nsoon made us sensible of the loss we suffered in the departure of\\r\\nDoctor Atkins; for he was grossly ignorant, and intolerably assuming,\\r\\nfalse, vindictive, and unforgiving; a merciless tyrant to his\\r\\ninferiors, an abject sycophant to those above him. In the morning after\\r\\nthe captain came on board, our first mate, according to custom, went to\\r\\nwait on him with a sick list, which, when this grim commander had\\r\\nperused, he cried with a stern countenance, â\\x80\\x9cBlood and cons! sixty-one\\r\\nsick people on board of my ship! Harkee, you sir, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have no sick in\\r\\nmy ship, by Gâ\\x80\\x94d.â\\x80\\x9d The Welshman replied, â\\x80\\x9che should be very glad to find\\r\\nno sick people on board: but, while it was otherwise, he did no more\\r\\nthan his duty in presenting him with a list.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou and your list may be\\r\\ndâ\\x80\\x94nâ\\x80\\x99d,â\\x80\\x9d said the captain, throwing it at him; â\\x80\\x9cI say, there shall be no\\r\\nsick in this ship while I have the command of her.â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Morgan, being\\r\\nnettled at this treatment, told him his indignation ought to be\\r\\ndirected to Cot Almighty, who visited his people with distempers, and\\r\\nnot to him, who contributed all in his power towards their cure. The\\r\\nbashaw, not being used to such behaviour in any of his officers, was\\r\\nenraged to fury at this satirical insinuation, and, stamping with his\\r\\nfoot, called him insolent scoundrel, threatening to have him pinioned\\r\\nto the deck, if he should presume to utter another syllable. But the\\r\\nblood of Caractacus being thoroughly heated, disdained to be restricted\\r\\nby such a command, and began to manifest itself in, â\\x80\\x9cCaptain Oakum, I\\r\\nam a shentleman of birth and parentage (look you), and peradventure I\\r\\nam moreover.â\\x80\\x9d Here his harangue was broken off by the captainâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsteward, who, being Morganâ\\x80\\x99s countryman, hurried him out of the cabin\\r\\nbefore he had time to exasperate his master to a greater degree, and\\r\\nthis would certainly have been the case; for the indignant Welshman\\r\\ncould hardly be hindered by his friendâ\\x80\\x99s arguments and entreaties from\\r\\nre-entering the presence-chamber, and defying Captain Oakum to his\\r\\nteeth. He was, however appeased at length, and came down to the berth,\\r\\nwhere, finding Thompson and me at work preparing medicines, he bade us\\r\\nleave off our lapour to go to play, for the captain, by his sole word,\\r\\nand power, and command, had driven sickness a pegging to the tevil, and\\r\\nthere was no more malady on board. So saying, he drank off a gill of\\r\\nbrandy sighed grievously three times, poured fort an ejaculation of\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCot pless my heart, liver, and lungs!â\\x80\\x9d and then began to sing a Welsh\\r\\nsong with great earnestness of visage, voice, and gesture. I could not\\r\\nconceive the meaning of this singular phenomenon, and saw by the looks\\r\\nof Thompson, who at the same time shook his head, that he suspected\\r\\npoor Cadwalladerâ\\x80\\x99s brains were unsettled. He, perceiving our amazement,\\r\\ntold us he would explain the mystery; but at the same time bade us take\\r\\nnotice, that he had lived poy, patchelor, married man, and widower,\\r\\nalmost forty years, and in all that time there was no man, nor motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nson in the whole world who durst use him so ill as Captain Oakum had\\r\\ndone. Then he acquainted us with the dialogue that passed between them,\\r\\nas I have already related it: and had no sooner finished this narration\\r\\nthan he received a message from the surgeon, to bring the sick-list to\\r\\nthe quarter-deck, for the captain had ordered all the patients thither\\r\\nto be reviewed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis inhuman order shocked us extremely, as we knew it would be\\r\\nimpossible to carry some of them on the deck, without imminent danger\\r\\nof their lives: but, as we likewise knew it would be to no purpose for\\r\\nus to remonstrate against it, we repaired to the quarter-deck in a\\r\\nbody, to see this extraordinary muster; Morgan observing by the way,\\r\\nthat the captain was going to send to the other world a great many\\r\\nevidences to testify against himself. When we appeared upon deck, the\\r\\ncaptain bade the doctor, who stood bowing at his right hand, look at\\r\\nthese lazy lubberly sons of bitches, who were good for nothing on board\\r\\nbut to eat the kingâ\\x80\\x99s provision, and encourage idleness in the\\r\\nskulkers. The surgeon grinned approbation, and, taking the list, began\\r\\nto examine the complaints of each as they could crawl to the place\\r\\nappointed. The first who came under his cognizance was a poor fellow\\r\\njust freed of a fever, which had weakened him so much that he could\\r\\nhardly stand. Mr. Mackshane (for that was the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s name), having\\r\\nfelt his pulse, protested he was as well as any man in the world; and\\r\\nthe captain delivered him over to the boatswainâ\\x80\\x99s mate, with orders\\r\\nthat he should receive a round dozen at the gangway immediately, for\\r\\ncounterfeiting himself sick; but, before the discipline could be\\r\\nexecuted, the man dropped down on the deck, and had well nigh perished\\r\\nunder the hands of the executioner. The next patient to be considered,\\r\\nlaboured under a quartan ague, and, being then in his interval of\\r\\nhealth, discovered no other symptoms of distemper than a pale meagre\\r\\ncountenance and emaciated body; upon which he was declared fit for\\r\\nduty, and turned over to the boatswain; but, being resolved to disgrace\\r\\nthe doctor, died upon the forecastle next day, during his cold fit. The\\r\\nthird complained of a pleuritic stitch, and spitting of blood, for\\r\\nwhich Doctor Mackshane prescribed exercise at the pump to promote\\r\\nexpectoration! but whether this was improper for one in his situation,\\r\\nor that it was used to excess, I know not, but in less than\\r\\nhalf-an-hour he was suffocated with a deluge of blood that issued from\\r\\nhis lungs. A fourth, with much difficulty, climbed to the quarter-deck,\\r\\nbeing loaded with a monstrous ascites, or dropsy, that invaded his\\r\\nchest so much, he could scarce fetch his breath; but his disease being\\r\\ninterpreted into fat, occasioned by idleness and excess of eating, he\\r\\nwas ordered, with a view to promote perspiration and enlarge his chest,\\r\\nto go aloft immediately. It was in vain for this unwieldy wretch to\\r\\nallege his utter incapacity; the boatswainâ\\x80\\x99s driver was commanded to\\r\\nwhip him up with the cat-and-nine-tails; the smart of this application\\r\\nmade him exert himself so much, that he actually arrived at the puttock\\r\\nshrouds; but when the enormous weight of his body had nothing else to\\r\\nsupport than his weakened arms, either out of spite or necessity, he\\r\\nquitted his hold, and plunged into the sea, where he must have been\\r\\ndrowned, had not a sailor, who was in a boat alongside, saved his life,\\r\\nby keeping him afloat till he was hoisted on board by a tackle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be tedious and disagreeable to describe the fate of every\\r\\nmiserable object that suffered by the inhumanity and ignorance of the\\r\\ncaptain and surgeon, who so wantonly sacrificed the lives of their\\r\\nfellow-creatures. Many were brought up in the height of fevers, and\\r\\nrendered delirious by the injuries they received in the way. Some gave\\r\\nup the ghost in the presence of their inspectors; and others, who were\\r\\nordered to their duties, languished a few days at work among their\\r\\nfellows, and then departed without any ceremony. On the whole, the\\r\\nnumber of the sick was reduced to less than a dozen; and the authors of\\r\\nthis reduction were applauding themselves for the services they had\\r\\ndone to their king and country, when the boatswainâ\\x80\\x99s mate informed his\\r\\nhonour, that there was a man below lashed to his hammock, by direction\\r\\nof the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s mate, and that he begged hard to be released;\\r\\naffirming, he had been so maltreated only for a grudge Mr. Morgan bore\\r\\nhim, and that he was as much in his senses as any man aboard. The\\r\\ncaptain hearing this, darted a severe look at the Welshman, and ordered\\r\\nthe man to be brought up immediately; upon which, Morgan protested with\\r\\ngreat fervency, that the person in question was as mad as a March hare;\\r\\nand begged for the love of Cot, they would at least keep his arms\\r\\npinioned during his examination, to prevent him from doing mischief.\\r\\nThis request the commander granted for his own sake, and the patient\\r\\nwas produced, who insisted upon his being in his right wits with such\\r\\ncalmness and strength of argument, that everybody present was inclined\\r\\nto believe him, except Morgan, who affirmed there was no trusting to\\r\\nappearances; for he himself had been so much imposed upon by his\\r\\nbehaviour two days before, that he had actually unbound him with his\\r\\nown hands, and had well nigh been murdered for his pains: this was\\r\\nconfirmed by the evidence of one of the waiters, who declared he had\\r\\npulled this patient from the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s mate, whom he had gotten down,\\r\\nand almost strangled. To this the man answered, that the witness was a\\r\\ncreature of Morganâ\\x80\\x99s, and suborned to give his testimony against him by\\r\\nthe malice of the mate, whom the defendant had affronted, by\\r\\ndiscovering to the people on board, that Mr. Morganâ\\x80\\x99s wife kept a\\r\\ngin-shop in Ragfair. This anecdote produced a laugh at the expense of\\r\\nthe Welshman, who, shaking his head with some emotion, said, â\\x80\\x9cAy, ay,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x99tis no matter. Cot knows, it is an arrant falsehood.â\\x80\\x9d Captain Oakum,\\r\\nwithout any farther hesitation, ordered the fellow to be unfettered; at\\r\\nthe same time, threatening to make Morgan exchange situations with him\\r\\nfor his spite; but the Briton no sooner heard the decision in favour of\\r\\nthe madman, than he got up to the mizen-shrouds, crying to Thompson and\\r\\nme to get out of his reach, for we should see him play the devil with a\\r\\nvengeance. We did not think fit to disregard his caution, and\\r\\naccordingly got up on the poop, whence we beheld the maniac (as soon as\\r\\nhe was released) fly at the captain like a fury, crying, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll let you\\r\\nknow, you scoundrel, that I am commander of this vessel,â\\x80\\x9d and pummel\\r\\nhim without mercy. The surgeon, who went to the assistance of his\\r\\npatron, shared the same fate; and it was with the utmost difficulty\\r\\nthat he was mastered at last, after having done great execution among\\r\\nthose who opposed him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Captain enraged, threatens to put the Madman to death with his own\\r\\nhandâ\\x80\\x94is diverted from that resolution by the arguments and persuasion\\r\\nof the first Lieutenant and Surgeonâ\\x80\\x94we set sail for St. Helenâ\\x80\\x99s, join\\r\\nthe fleet under the command of Sir Câ\\x80\\x94 Oâ\\x80\\x94gle, and proceed for the West\\r\\nIndiesâ\\x80\\x94are overtaken by a terrible tempestâ\\x80\\x94my friend Jack Rattlin has\\r\\nhis leg broke by a fall from the mainyardâ\\x80\\x94the behaviour of Mr.\\r\\nMackshaneâ\\x80\\x94Jack opposes the amputation of his limb, in which he is\\r\\nseconded by Morgan and me, we undertake the cure and perform it\\r\\nsuccessfully\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe captain was carried into his cabin, so enraged with the treatment\\r\\nhe had received, that he ordered the fellow to be brought before him,\\r\\nthat he might have the pleasure of pistoling him with his own hand; and\\r\\nwould certainly have satisfied his revenge in this manner, had not the\\r\\nfirst lieutenant remonstrated against it, by observing that, in all\\r\\nappearances, the fellow was not mad, but desperate; that he had been\\r\\nhired by some enemy of the captainâ\\x80\\x99s to him, and therefore ought to be\\r\\nkept in irons till he could be brought to a court-martial, which, no\\r\\ndoubt, would sift the affair to the bottom (by which means important\\r\\ndiscoveries might be made), and then sentence the criminal to a death\\r\\naccording to his demerits. This suggestion, improbable as it was, had\\r\\nthe desired effect upon the captain, being exactly calculated for the\\r\\nmeridan of his intellects; more especially as Dr. Mackshane espoused\\r\\nthis opinion, in consequence of his previous declaration that the man\\r\\nwas not mad. Morgan finding there was no more damage done, could not\\r\\nhelp discovering by his countenance the pleasure he enjoyed on this\\r\\noccasion; and, while he bathed the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s face with an embrocation,\\r\\nventured to ask him, whether he thought there were more fools or madmen\\r\\non board? But he would have been wiser in containing this sally, which\\r\\nhis patient carefully laid up in his memory, to be taken notice of at a\\r\\nmore fit season. Meanwhile we weighed anchor, and, on our way to the\\r\\nDowns, the madman, who was treated as a prisoner, took an opportunity,\\r\\nwhile the sentinel attending him was at the head, to leap and frustrate\\r\\nthe revenge of the captain. We stayed not long at the Downs, but took\\r\\nthe benefit of the first easterly wind to go round to Spithead: where,\\r\\nhaving received provisions on board for six months, we sailed from St.\\r\\nHelenâ\\x80\\x99s in the grand fleet bound for the West Indies, on the\\r\\never-memorable expedition of Carthagena.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not without great mortification I saw myself on the point of\\r\\nbeing transported to such a distant and unhealthy climate, destitute of\\r\\nevery convenience that could render such a voyage supportable, and\\r\\nunder the dominion of an arbitrary tyrant, whose command was almost\\r\\nintolerable; however, as these complaints were common to a great many\\r\\non board, I resolved to submit patiently to my fate, and contrive to\\r\\nmake myself as easy as the nature of the case would allow. We got out\\r\\nof the channel with a prosperous breeze, which died away, leaving us\\r\\nbecalmed about fifty leagues to the westward of the Lizard: but this\\r\\nstate of inaction did not last long; for next night our maintop-sail\\r\\nwas split by the wind, which, in the morning, increased to a hurricane.\\r\\nI was awakened by a most horrible din, occasioned by the play of the\\r\\ngun carriages upon the decks above, the cracking of cabins, the howling\\r\\nof the wind through the shrouds, the confused noise of the shipâ\\x80\\x99s crew,\\r\\nthe pipes of the boatswain and his mates, the trumpets of the\\r\\nlieutenants, and the clanking of the chain pumps. Morgan who had never\\r\\nbeen at sea before, turned out in a great hurry, crying, â\\x80\\x9cCot have\\r\\nmercy and compassion upon us! I believe, we have cot upon the confines\\r\\nof Lucifer and the dâ\\x80\\x94nâ\\x80\\x99d!â\\x80\\x9d while poor Thompson lay quaking in his\\r\\nhammock, putting up petitions to heaven for our safety. I rose and\\r\\njoined the Welshman, with whom (after having fortified ourselves with\\r\\nbrandy) I went above; but if my sense of hearing was startled before,\\r\\nhow must my sight have been apalled in beholding the effects of the\\r\\nstorm! The sea was swelled into billows mountain-high, on the top of\\r\\nwhich our ship sometimes hung as if it were about to be precipitated to\\r\\nthe abyss below! Sometimes we sank between two waves that rose on each\\r\\nside higher than our topmast-head, and threatened by dashing together\\r\\nto overwhelm us in a moment! Of all our fleet, consisting of a hundred\\r\\nand fifty sail, scarce twelve appeared, and these driving under their\\r\\nbare poles, at the mercy of the tempest. At length the mast of one of\\r\\nthem gave way, and tumbled overboard with a hideous crash! Nor was the\\r\\nprospect in our own ship much more agreeable; a number of officers and\\r\\nsailors ran backward and forward with distraction in their looks,\\r\\nhalloaing to one another, and undetermined what they should attend to\\r\\nfirst. Some clung to the yards, endeavouring to unbend the sails that\\r\\nwere split into a thousand pieces flapping in the wind; others tried to\\r\\nfurl those which were yet whole, while the masts, at every pitch, bent\\r\\nand quivered like twigs, as if they would have shivered into\\r\\ninnumerable splinters! While I considered this scene with equal terror\\r\\nand astonishment, one of the main braces broke, by the shock whereof\\r\\ntwo sailors were flung from the yardâ\\x80\\x99s arm into the sea, where they\\r\\nperished, and poor Jack Rattlin thrown down upon the deck, at the\\r\\nexpense of a broken leg. Morgan and I ran immediately to his\\r\\nassistance, and found a splinter of the shin-bone thrust by the\\r\\nviolence of the fall through the skin; as this was a case of too great\\r\\nconsequence to be treated without the authority of the doctor I went\\r\\ndown to his cabin to inform him of the accident, as well as to bring up\\r\\ndressings which we always kept ready prepared. I entered his apartment\\r\\nwithout any ceremony, and, by the glimmering of a lamp, perceived him\\r\\non his knees before something that very much resembled a crucifix; but\\r\\nthis I will not insist upon, that I may not seem too much a slave to\\r\\ncommon report, which indeed assisted my conjecture on this occasion, by\\r\\nrepresenting Dr. Mackshane as a member of the church of Rome. Be this\\r\\nas it will, he got up in a sort of confusion, occasioned (I suppose) by\\r\\nhis being disturbed in his devotion, and in a trice snatched the\\r\\nsubject of my suspicion from my sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter making an apology for my intrusion, I acquainted him with the\\r\\nsituation of Rattlin, but could by no means prevail upon him to visit\\r\\nhim on deck, where he lay; he bade me desire the boatswain to order\\r\\nsome of the men to carry him down to the cockpit, â\\x80\\x9cand in the\\r\\nmeantime,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI will direct Thompson to get ready the\\r\\ndressings.â\\x80\\x9d When I signified to the boatswain the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s desire, he\\r\\nswore a terrible oath, that he could not spare one man from deck,\\r\\nbecause he expected the mast would go by the board every minute. This\\r\\npiece of information did not at all contribute to my peace of mind;\\r\\nhowever, as my friend Rattlin complained very much, with the assistance\\r\\nof Morgan I supported him to the lower deck, whither Mr. Mackshane,\\r\\nafter much entreaty, ventured to come, attended by Thompson, with a box\\r\\nfull of dressings, and his own servant, who carried a whole set of\\r\\ncapital instruments. He examined the fracture and the wound, and\\r\\nconcluding, from a livid colour extending itself upon the limb, that\\r\\nmortification would ensue, resolved to amputate the leg immediately.\\r\\nThis was a dreadful sentence to the patient, who, recruiting himself\\r\\nwith a quid of tobacco, pronounced with a woful countenance, â\\x80\\x9cWhat! is\\r\\nthere no remedy, doctor! must I be dockâ\\x80\\x99d? canâ\\x80\\x99t you splice it?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAssuredly, Doctor Mackshane,â\\x80\\x9d said the first mate, â\\x80\\x9cwith submission,\\r\\nand deference, and veneration, to your superior apilities, and\\r\\nopportunities, and stations, look you, I do apprehend, and conjure, and\\r\\naver, that there is no occasion nor necessity to smite off this poor\\r\\nmanâ\\x80\\x99s leg.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cGod Almighty bless you, dear Welshman!â\\x80\\x9d cried Rattlin,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cmay you have fair wind and weather wheresoever youâ\\x80\\x99re bound, and come\\r\\nto an anchor in the road of heaven at last!â\\x80\\x9d Mackshane, very much\\r\\nincensed at his mateâ\\x80\\x99s differing in opinion from him, so openly,\\r\\nanswered, that he was not bound to give an account of his practice to\\r\\nhim; and in a peremptory tone, ordered him to apply the tourniquet. At\\r\\nthe sight of which, Jack, starting up, cried, â\\x80\\x9cAvast, avast! Dâ\\x80\\x94n my\\r\\nheart, if you clap your nippers on me, till I know wherefore! Mr.\\r\\nRandom, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you lend a hand towards saving my precious limb! Oddâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nheart, if Lieutenant Bowling was here, he would not suffer Jack\\r\\nRattlinâ\\x80\\x99s leg to be chopped off like a piece of old junk.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis pathetic address to me, joined to my inclination to serve my\\r\\nhonest friend, and the reasons I had to believe there was no danger in\\r\\ndelaying the amputation, induced me to declare myself of the first\\r\\nmateâ\\x80\\x99s opinion, and affirm that the preternatural colour of the skin\\r\\nwas owing to an inflammation, occasioned by a contusion, and common in\\r\\nall such cases, without any indication of an approaching gangrene.\\r\\nMorgan, who had a great opinion of my skill, manifestly exulted in my\\r\\nfellowship, and asked Thompsonâ\\x80\\x99s sentiments in the matter, in hopes of\\r\\nstrengthening our association with him too; but he, being of a meek\\r\\ndisposition, and either dreading the enmity of the surgeon, or speaking\\r\\nthe dictates of his own judgment, in a modest manner espoused the\\r\\nopinion of Mackshane, who by this time having consulted with himself,\\r\\ndetermined to act in such a manner as to screen himself from censure,\\r\\nand at the same time revenge himself on us, for our arrogance in\\r\\ncontradicting him. With this view, he asked if we would undertake to\\r\\ncure the leg at our peril: that is, be answerable for the consequence.\\r\\nTo this question, Morgan replied, that the lives of his creatures are\\r\\nat the hands of Cot alone; and it would be great presumption in him to\\r\\nundertake for an event that was in the power of his Maker, no more than\\r\\nthe doctor could promise to cure all the sick to whom he administered\\r\\nhis assistance; but if the patient would put himself under our\\r\\ndirection, we would do our endeavour to bring his distemper to a\\r\\nfavourable issue, to which at present we saw no obstruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nI signified my concurrence; and Rattlin was so overjoyed that, shaking\\r\\nus both by the hands, he swore nobody else should touch him, and, if he\\r\\ndied, his blood should be upon his own head. Mr. Mackshane, flattering\\r\\nhimself with the prospect of our miscarriage, went away, and left us to\\r\\nmanage it as we should think proper; accordingly, having sawed off part\\r\\nof the splinter that stuck through the skin, we reduced the fracture,\\r\\ndressed the wound, applied the eighteen-tailed bandage, and put the leg\\r\\nin a box, secundam artem. Everything succeeded according to our wish,\\r\\nand we had the satisfaction of not only preserving the poor fellowâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nleg, but likewise of rendering the doctor contemptible among the shipâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncompany, who had all their eyes on us during the course of this cure,\\r\\nwhich was completed in six weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMackshaneâ\\x80\\x99s maliceâ\\x80\\x94I am taken up and imprisoned for a spyâ\\x80\\x94Morgan meets\\r\\nwith the same fateâ\\x80\\x94Thompson is tampered with to turn evidence against\\r\\nusâ\\x80\\x94disdains the proposal, and is maltreated for his integrityâ\\x80\\x94Morgan is\\r\\nreleased to assist the Surgeon during an engagement with some French\\r\\nships-of-warâ\\x80\\x94I remain fettered on the poop, exposed to the enemyâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nshot, and grow delirious with fearâ\\x80\\x94am comforted after the battle by\\r\\nMorgan, who speaks freely of the captain, is overheard by the sentinel,\\r\\nwho informs against him, and again imprisonedâ\\x80\\x94Thompson grows desperate,\\r\\nand, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Morgan and me, goes overboard\\r\\nin the night\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime the storm subsided into a brisk gale, that carried us\\r\\ninto the warm latitudes, where the weather became intolerable, and the\\r\\ncrew very sickly. The doctor left nothing unattempted towards the\\r\\ncompletion of his vengeance against the Welshman and me. He went among\\r\\nthe sick under pretence of inquiring into their grievances, with a view\\r\\nof picking up complaints to our prejudice; but, finding himself\\r\\nfrustrated in that expectation by the goodwill we had procured from the\\r\\npatients by our diligence and humanity, he took the resolution of\\r\\nlistening to our conversation, by hiding himself behind the canvas that\\r\\nsurrounded our berth; here too he was detected by the boy of our mess,\\r\\nwho acquainted us with this piece of behaviour, and one night, while we\\r\\nwere picking a large bone of salt beef, Morgan discerned something stir\\r\\non the outside of our hangings, which immediately interpreting to be\\r\\nthe doctor, he tipped me the wink, and pointed to the place, where I\\r\\ncould perceive somebody standing; upon which, I snatched up the bone,\\r\\nand levelled it with all my force at him, saying, â\\x80\\x9cWhoever you are,\\r\\ntake that for your curiosity.â\\x80\\x9d It had the desired effect, for we heard\\r\\nthe listener tumble down, and afterwards crawl to his own cabin. I\\r\\napplauded myself much for this feat, which turned out one of the most\\r\\nunlucky exploits of my life, Mackshane, from that time, marking me out\\r\\nfor destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout a week after this exploit, as I was going my rounds among the\\r\\nsick, I was taken prisoner, and carried to the poop by the\\r\\nmaster-at-arms, where I was loaded with irons, and stapled to the deck,\\r\\non pretence that I was a spy on board, and had conspired against the\\r\\ncaptainâ\\x80\\x99s life. How ridiculous soever this imputation was, I did not\\r\\nfail to suffer by it all the rigour that could be shown to the worst of\\r\\ncriminals, being exposed in this miserable condition to the scorching\\r\\nheat of the sun by day, and the unwholesome damps by night, during the\\r\\nspace of twelve days, in which I was neither brought to trial, nor\\r\\nexamined touching the probability of the charge. I had no sooner\\r\\nrecovered the use of my reflection, which had been quite overthrown by\\r\\nthis accident, than I sent for Thompson, who, after condoling me on the\\r\\noccasion, hinted, that I owed this misfortune to the hatred of the\\r\\ndoctor, who had given an information against me to the captain, in\\r\\nconsequence of which I was arrested, and all my papers seized. While I\\r\\nwas cursing my capricious fate, I saw Morgan ascend the poop, guarded\\r\\nby two corporals, who made him sit down by me, that he might be\\r\\npinioned in the same machine. Notwithstanding my situation, I could\\r\\nscarce refrain from laughing at the countenance of my fellow prisoner,\\r\\nwho, without speaking one word, allowed his feet to be inclosed in the\\r\\nrings provided for that purpose; but, when they pretended to fasten him\\r\\non his back he grew outrageous, and drawing a large couteau from his\\r\\nside-pocket, threatened to rip up the belly of the first man that\\r\\nshould approach him, in order to treat him in such an unworthy manner.\\r\\nThey were prepared to use him very roughly, when the lieutenant on the\\r\\nquarter-deck called up to them to let him remain as he was. He then\\r\\ncrept towards me, and, taking me by the hand, bade me â\\x80\\x9cput my trust in\\r\\nCot.â\\x80\\x9d And looking at Thompson, who sat by us trembling, with a pale\\r\\nvisage; told him there were two more rings for his feet, and he should\\r\\nbe glad to find him in such good company. But it was not the intention\\r\\nof our adversary to include the second mate in our fate: him he\\r\\nexpected to be his drudge in attending the sick and, if possible, his\\r\\nevidence against us: with this view he sounded him afar off, but,\\r\\nfinding his integrity incorruptible, harrassed him so much out of\\r\\nspite, that in a short time this mild creature grew weary of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I and my fellow prisoner comforted each other in our tribulation,\\r\\nthe admiral discovered four sail to leeward and made signal for our\\r\\nship and four more to chase: hereupon everything was cleared for an\\r\\nengagement, and Mackshane, foreseeing he should have occasion for more\\r\\nassistants than one obtained Morganâ\\x80\\x99s liberty, while I was let in this\\r\\ndeplorable posture to the chance of battle. It was almost dark when we\\r\\ncame up with the sternmost chase, which we hailed, and inquired who\\r\\nthey were. They gave us to understand they were French men-of-war, upon\\r\\nwhich Captain Oakum commanded them to send their boat on board of him!\\r\\nbut they refused, telling him, if he had any business with them, to\\r\\ncome on board of their ship: he then threatened to pour in a broadside\\r\\nupon them, which they promised to retain. Both sides were as good as\\r\\ntheir word, and the engagement began with great fury. The reader may\\r\\nguess how I passed my time, lying in this helpless situation, amidst\\r\\nthe terrors of a sea-fight; expecting every moment to be cut asunder,\\r\\nor dashed in pieces by the enemyâ\\x80\\x99s shot! I endeavoured to compose\\r\\nmyself as much as possible, by reflecting that I was not a whit more\\r\\nexposed than those who were stationed about me; but, when I beheld them\\r\\nemployed without intermission in annoying the foe, and encouraged by\\r\\nthe society and behaviour of one another, I could easily perceive a\\r\\nwide difference between their condition and mine: however, I concealed\\r\\nmy agitation as well as I could till the head of the officer of marines\\r\\nwho stood near me, being shot off, bounced from the deck athwart my\\r\\nface, leaving me well nigh blinded with brains. I could contain myself\\r\\nno longer, but began to bellow with all the strength of my lungs; when\\r\\na drummer, coming towards me asked if I was wounded, and, before I\\r\\ncould answer, received a great shot in his belly, which tore out his\\r\\nentrails, and he fell flat on my breast. This accident entirely bereft\\r\\nme of all discretion; I redoubled my cries, which were drowned in the\\r\\nnoise of the battle; and, finding myself disregarded, lost all\\r\\npatience, and became frantic. I vented my rage in oaths and\\r\\nexecrations, till my spirits, being quite exhausted, I remained quiet,\\r\\nas insensible of the load that oppressed me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe engagement lasted till broad day, when Captain Oakum, finding he\\r\\nwas like to gain neither honour nor advantage by the affair, pretended\\r\\nto be undeceived by seeing their colours; and, hailing the ship whom he\\r\\nhad fought all night, protested he believed them Spaniards; and the\\r\\nguns being silenced on each side, ordered the barge to be hoisted out,\\r\\nand went on board the French commodore. Our loss amounted to ten\\r\\nkilled, and eighteen wounded, most part of whom afterwards died. My\\r\\nfellow-mates had no sooner despatched their business in the cock-pit,\\r\\nthan, full of friendly concern, they came to visit me. Morgan,\\r\\nascending first, and seeing my face almost covered with brains and\\r\\nblood, concluded I was no longer a man for this world; and, calling to\\r\\nThompson with great emotion, bade him come up, and take his last\\r\\nfarewell of his comrade and countryman, who was posted to a better\\r\\nplace, where there were no Mackshanes nor Oakums to asperse and torment\\r\\nhim. â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said he, taking me by the hand, â\\x80\\x9cyou are going to a country\\r\\nwhere there is more respect sown to unfortunate shentlemen, and where\\r\\nyou will have the satisfaction of peholding your adversaries tossing\\r\\nupon pillows of purning primstone.â\\x80\\x9d Thompson, alarmed at this\\r\\napostrophe, made haste to the place where I lay, and sitting down by\\r\\nme, with tears in his eyes inquired into the nature of my calamity. By\\r\\nthis time I had recollected myself so far as to be able to converse\\r\\nrationally with my friends, whom, to their great satisfaction, I\\r\\nimmediately undeceived with regard to their apprehension of my being\\r\\nmortally wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I had got myself disengaged from the carnage in which I wallowed,\\r\\nand partaken of a refreshment which my friends brought along with them,\\r\\nwe entered into discourse upon the hardships we sustained, and spoke\\r\\nvery freely of the author of our misery; but our discourse being\\r\\noverheard by the sentinel who guarded me, he was no sooner relieved\\r\\nthan he reported to the captain every syllable of our conversation,\\r\\naccording to the orders he had received. The effect of this information\\r\\nsoon appeared in the arrival of the master-at-arms, who replaced Morgan\\r\\nin his former station, and gave the second mate a caution to keep a\\r\\nstrict guard over his tongue, if he did not choose to accompany us in\\r\\nour confinement. Thompson, foreseeing that the whole slavery of\\r\\nattending the sick and wounded, as well as the cruelty of Mackshane,\\r\\nmust now fall upon his shoulders, grew desperate at the prospect, and,\\r\\nthough I never heard him swear before, imprecated dreadful curses on\\r\\nthe heads of his oppressors, declaring that he would rather quit life\\r\\naltogether than be much longer under the power of such barbarians. I\\r\\nwas not a little startled at his vivacity, and endeavoured to alleviate\\r\\nhis complaints, by representing the subject of my own, with as much\\r\\naggravation as it would bear, by which comparison he might see the\\r\\nbalance of misfortune lay on my side, and take an example from me of\\r\\nfortitude and submission, till such time as we could procure redress,\\r\\nwhich I hoped was not far off, considering that we should probably be\\r\\nin a harbour in less than three days, where we should have an\\r\\nopportunity of preferring our complaints to the admiral. The Welshman\\r\\njoined in my remonstrance, and was at great pains to demonstrate that\\r\\nit was every manâ\\x80\\x99s duty as well as interest to resign himself to the\\r\\ndivine will, and look upon himself as a sentinel upon duty, who is by\\r\\nno means at liberty to leave his post before he is relieved. Thompson\\r\\nlistened attentively to what he said, and at last, shedding a flood of\\r\\ntears, shook his hand, and left us without making any reply. About\\r\\neleven at night he came to see us again with a settled gloom on his\\r\\ncountenance, and gave us to understand that he had undergone excessive\\r\\ntoil since he saw us, and in recompense had been grossly abused by the\\r\\ndoctor, who taxed him with being confederate with us, in a design of\\r\\ntaking away his life and that of the captain. After some time spent in\\r\\nmutual exhortation, he got up, and squeezing me by the hand with\\r\\nuncommon fervour, cried, â\\x80\\x9cGod bless you both!â\\x80\\x9d and left us to wonder at\\r\\nhis singular manner of parting with us, which did not fail to make a\\r\\ndeep impression on us both.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, when the hour of visitation came round, the unhappy young\\r\\nman was missing, and, after strict search, supposed to have gone\\r\\noverboard in the night; and this was certainly the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe lament the fate of our companionâ\\x80\\x94the Captain offers Morgan his\\r\\nliberty, which he refuses to acceptâ\\x80\\x94we are brought before him and\\r\\nexaminedâ\\x80\\x94Morgan is sent back into custody, whither also I am remanded\\r\\nafter a curious trial\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe news of this event affected my fellow prisoner and me extremely, as\\r\\nour unfortunate companion had justly acquired by his amiable\\r\\ndisposition the love and esteem of us both; and the more we regretted\\r\\nhis untimely fate, the greater horror we conceived for the villain who\\r\\nwas undoubtedly the occasion of it. This abandoned miscreant did not\\r\\ndiscover the least symptom of concern for Thompsonâ\\x80\\x99s death, although he\\r\\nmust have been conscious to himself of having driven him by ill usage\\r\\nto the fatal resolution, but desired the captain to set Morgan at\\r\\nliberty again to look after the patients. Accordingly one of the\\r\\ncorporals was sent up to unfetter him, but he protested he would not be\\r\\nreleased until he should know for what he was confined; nor would he be\\r\\na tennisball, nor a shuttlecock, nor a trudge, nor a scullion, to any\\r\\ncaptain under the sun. Oakum, finding him obstinate, and fearing it\\r\\nwould not be in his power to exercise his tyranny much longer with\\r\\nimpunity, was willing to show some appearance of justice and therefore\\r\\nordered us both to be brought before him on the quarter-deck, where he\\r\\nsat in state, with his cleric on one side, and his counsellor Mackshane\\r\\non the other. When we approached, he honoured us with this salutation:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo, gentlemen, dâ\\x80\\x94n my blood! many a captain in the navy would have\\r\\nordered you both to be tucked up to the yardâ\\x80\\x99s arm, without either\\r\\njudge or jury, for the crimes you have been guilty of; but, dâ\\x80\\x94n my\\r\\nblood, I have too much good nature in allowing such dogs as you to make\\r\\ndefence.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCaptain Oakum,â\\x80\\x9d said my fellow-sufferer, â\\x80\\x9ccertainly it is in\\r\\nyour power (Cot help the while) to tack us all up at your will, desire,\\r\\nand pleasures. And perhaps it would be petter for some of us to be\\r\\ntucked up than to undergo the miseries to which we have been exposed.\\r\\nSo may the farmer hang his kids for his diversion, and amusement, and\\r\\nmirth; but there is such a thing as justice, if not upon earth, surely\\r\\nin heaven, that will punish with fire and primstone all those who take\\r\\naway the lives of innocent people out of wantonness, and parparity\\r\\n(look you). In the mean time. I shall be glad to know the crimes laid\\r\\nto my charge, and see the person who accuses me.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThat you shall,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid the captain; â\\x80\\x9chere, doctor, what have you to say?â\\x80\\x9d Mackshane,\\r\\nstepping forward, hemmed a good while, in order to clear his throat,\\r\\nand, before he began, Morgan accosted him thus: â\\x80\\x9cDoctor Mackshane, look\\r\\nin my faceâ\\x80\\x94look in the face of an honest man, who abhors a false\\r\\nwitness as he abhors the tevil, and Cot be judge between you and me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThe doctor, not minding this conjuration, made the following speech, as\\r\\nnear as I can remember: â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, Mr. Morgan; to be sure\\r\\nwhat you say is just, in regard to an honest man, and if so be it\\r\\nappears as how you are an honest man, then it is my opinion that you\\r\\ndeserve to be acquitted, in relation to that there affair, for I tell\\r\\nyou what, Captain Oakum is resolved for to do everybody justice. As for\\r\\nmy own part, all that I have to allege is, that I have been informed\\r\\nyou have spoken disrespectful words against your captain, who, to be\\r\\nsure, is the most honourable and generous commander in the kingâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nservice, without asparagement or acception of man, woman, or child.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving uttered this elegant harangue, on which he seemed to plume\\r\\nhimself, Morgan replied, â\\x80\\x9cI do partly guess, and conceive, and\\r\\nunderstand your meaning, which I wish could be more explicit; but,\\r\\nhowever, I do suppose, I am not to be condemned upon bare hearsay; or,\\r\\nif I am convicted of speaking disrespectfully of Captain Oakum, I hope\\r\\nthere is no treason in my words.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cBut thereâ\\x80\\x99s mutiny, by Gâ\\x80\\x94d, and\\r\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s death by the articles of war!â\\x80\\x9d cried Oakum: â\\x80\\x9cIn the meantime,\\r\\nlet the witnesses be called.â\\x80\\x9d Hereupon Mackshaneâ\\x80\\x99s servant appeared,\\r\\nand the boy of our mess, whom they had seduced and tutored for the\\r\\npurpose. The first declared, that Morgan as he descended the\\r\\ncockpit-ladder one day, cursed the captain, and called him a savage\\r\\nbeast, saying, he ought to be hunted down as an enemy to mankind.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis,â\\x80\\x9d said the clerk, â\\x80\\x9cis a strong presumption of a design, formed\\r\\nagainst the captainâ\\x80\\x99s life. For why? It presupposes malice\\r\\naforethought, and a criminal intention a priori.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cRight,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\ncaptain to this miserable grub, who had been an attorneyâ\\x80\\x99s boy, â\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\nshall have law enough: hereâ\\x80\\x99s Cook and Littlejohn to it.â\\x80\\x9d This evidence\\r\\nwas confirmed by the boy, who affirmed, he heard the first mate say,\\r\\nthat the captain had no more bowels than a bear, and the surgeon had no\\r\\nmore brain than an ass. Then the sentinel, who heard our discourse on\\r\\nthe poop was examined, and informed the court that the Welshman assured\\r\\nme, Captain Oakum and Doctor Mackshane would toss upon billows of\\r\\nburning brimstone in hell for their barbarity. The clerk observed, that\\r\\nthere was an evident prejudication, which confirmed the former\\r\\nsuspicion of a conspiracy against the life of Captain Oakum; for,\\r\\nbecause, how could Morgan so positively pronounce that the captain and\\r\\nsurgeon would dâ\\x80\\x94nâ\\x80\\x99d, unless he had intention to make away with them\\r\\nbefore they could have time to repent? This sage explanation had great\\r\\nweight with our noble commander, who exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cWhat have you to say\\r\\nto this, Taffy? you seem to be taken all a-back, brother, ha!â\\x80\\x9d Morgan\\r\\nwas too much of a gentleman to disown the text, although he absolutely\\r\\ndenied the truth of the comment. Upon which the captain, strutting up\\r\\nto him with a ferocious countenance, said, â\\x80\\x9cSo Mr. son of a bitch, you\\r\\nconfess you honoured me with the names of bear and beast, and\\r\\npronounced my damnation? Dâ\\x80\\x94n my heart! I have a good mind to have you\\r\\nbrought to a court-martial and hangâ\\x80\\x99d, you dog.â\\x80\\x9d Here Mackshane, having\\r\\noccasion for an assistant, interposed, and begged the captain to pardon\\r\\nMr. Morgan with his wonted goodness, upon condition that he the\\r\\ndelinquent should make such submission as the nature of his\\r\\nmisdemeanour demanded. Upon which the Cambro-Briton, who on this\\r\\noccasion would have made no submission to the Great Mogul, surrounded\\r\\nwith his guards, thanked the doctor for his mediation, and acknowledged\\r\\nhimself in the wrong for calling the image of Cot a peast, â\\x80\\x9cbut,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nhe, â\\x80\\x9cI spoke by metaphor, and parable, and comparison, and types; as we\\r\\nsignify meekness by a lamb, lechery by a goat, and craftiness by a fox;\\r\\nso we liken ignorance to an ass, and brutality to a bear, and fury to a\\r\\ntiger; therefore I made use of these similes to express my sentiments\\r\\n(look you), and what I said before Cot, I will not unsay before man nor\\r\\npeast neither.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nOakum was so provoked at this insolence (as he termed it,) that he\\r\\nordered him forthwith to be carried to the place of his confinement,\\r\\nand his clerk to proceed on the examination of me. The first question\\r\\nput to me was touching the place of my nativity, which I declared to be\\r\\nthe north of Scotland. â\\x80\\x9cThe north of Ireland more like!â\\x80\\x9d cried the\\r\\ncaptain; â\\x80\\x9cbut we shall bring you up presently.â\\x80\\x9d He then asked what\\r\\nreligion I professed; and when I answered â\\x80\\x9cthe Protestant,â\\x80\\x9d swore I was\\r\\nan arrant Roman as ever went to mass. â\\x80\\x9cCome, come, clerk,â\\x80\\x9d continued\\r\\nhe, â\\x80\\x9ccatechise him a little on this subject.â\\x80\\x9d But before I relate the\\r\\nparticulars of the clerkâ\\x80\\x99s inquiries, it will not be amiss to inform\\r\\nthe reader that our commander himself was an Hibernian, and, if not\\r\\nshrewdly belied, a Roman Catholic to boot. â\\x80\\x9cYou say, you are a\\r\\nProtestant,â\\x80\\x9d said the clerk; â\\x80\\x9cmake the sign of the cross with your\\r\\nfinger, so, and swear upon it to that affirmation.â\\x80\\x9d When I was about to\\r\\nperform the ceremony, the captain cried with some emotion, â\\x80\\x9cNo, no,\\r\\ndâ\\x80\\x94me! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have no profanation neither. But go on with your\\r\\ninterrogations.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell then,â\\x80\\x9d proceeded my examiner, â\\x80\\x9chow many\\r\\nsacraments are there?â\\x80\\x9d To which I replied, â\\x80\\x9cTwo.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat are they?â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nhe. I answered, â\\x80\\x9cBaptism and the Lordâ\\x80\\x99s Supper.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAnd so you would\\r\\nexplode confirmation and marriage altogether?â\\x80\\x9d said Oakum. â\\x80\\x9cI thought\\r\\nthis fellow was a rank Roman.â\\x80\\x9d The clerk, though he was bred under an\\r\\nattorney, could not refrain from blushing at this blunder, which he\\r\\nendeavoured to conceal, by observing, that these decoys would not do\\r\\nwith me, who seemed to be an old offender. He went on with asking, if I\\r\\nbelieved in transubstantiation; but I treated the notion of real\\r\\npresence with such disrespect, that his patron was scandalised at my\\r\\nimpiety, and commanded him to proceed to the plot. Whereupon this\\r\\nmiserable pettifogger told me, there was great reason to suspect me of\\r\\nbeing a spy on board, and that I had entered into a conspiracy with\\r\\nThompson, and others not yet detected, against the life of Captain\\r\\nOakum, which accusation they pretended to support by the evidence of\\r\\nour boy, who declared he had often heard the deceased Thompson and me\\r\\nwhispering together, and could distinguish the words, â\\x80\\x9cOakum, rascal,\\r\\npoison, pistol;â\\x80\\x9d by which expressions it appeared, we did intend to use\\r\\nsinister means to accomplish his destruction. That the death of\\r\\nThompson seemed to confirm this conjecture, who, either feeling the\\r\\nstings of remorse for being engaged in such a horrid confederacy, or\\r\\nfearing a discovery, by which he must have infallibly suffered an\\r\\nignominious death, had put a fatal period to his own existence. But\\r\\nwhat established the truth of the whole was, a book in cyphers found\\r\\namong my papers, which exactly tallied with one found in his chest,\\r\\nafter his disappearance. This, he observed, was a presumption very near\\r\\npositive proof, and would determine any jury in Christendom to find me\\r\\nguilty. In my own defence, I alleged, that I had been dragged on board\\r\\nat first very much against my inclination, as I could prove by the\\r\\nevidence of some people now in the ship, consequently could have no\\r\\ndesign of becoming spy at that time; and ever since had been entirely\\r\\nout of the reach of any correspondence that could justly entail that\\r\\nsuspicion upon me. As for conspiring against my captainâ\\x80\\x99s life, it\\r\\ncould not be supposed that any man in his right wits would harbour the\\r\\nleast thought of such an undertaking, which he could not possibly\\r\\nperform without certain infamy and ruin to himself, even if he had all\\r\\nthe inclination in the world. That, allowing the boyâ\\x80\\x99s evidence to be\\r\\ntrue (which I affirmed was false and malicious), nothing conclusive\\r\\ncould be gathered from a few incoherent words; neither was the fate of\\r\\nMr. Thompson a circumstance more favourable for the charge; for I had\\r\\nin my pocket a letter which too well explained that mystery, in a very\\r\\ndifferent manner from that which was supposed. With these words, I\\r\\nproduced the following letter, which Jack Rattlin brought to me the\\r\\nvery day after Thompson disappeared; and told me it was committed to\\r\\nhis care by the deceased, who made him promise not to deliver it\\r\\nsooner. The clerk, taking it out of my hand, read aloud the contents,\\r\\nwhich were these;\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98Dear Friend,â\\x80\\x94I am so much oppressed with the fatigue I daily and\\r\\nnightly undergo, and the barbarous usage of Doctor Mackshane, who is\\r\\nbent on your destruction as well as mine, that I am resolved to free\\r\\nmyself from this miserable life, and, before you receive this, shall be\\r\\nno more. I could have wished to die in your good opinion, which I am\\r\\nafraid I shall forfeit by the last act of my life; but, if you cannot\\r\\nacquit me, I know you will at least preserve some regard for the memory\\r\\nof an unfortunate young man who loved you. I recommend it to you, to\\r\\nbeware of Mackshane, whose revenge is implacable. I wish all prosperity\\r\\nto you and Mr. Morgan, to whom pray offer my last respects, and beg to\\r\\nbe remembered as your unhappy friend and countryman,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98William Thompson.â\\x80\\x99\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter was no sooner read, than Mackshane, in a transport of rage,\\r\\nsnatched it out of the clerkâ\\x80\\x99s hands, and tore it into a thousand\\r\\npieces, saying, it was a villainous forgery, contrived and executed by\\r\\nmyself. The captain and clerk declared themselves of the same opinion,\\r\\nalthough I insisted of having the remains of it compared with other\\r\\nwritings of Thompson, which they had in their possession; and I was\\r\\nordered to answer the last article of my accusation, namely, the book\\r\\nof ciphers found among my papers. â\\x80\\x9cThat is easily done,â\\x80\\x9d said I. â\\x80\\x9cWhat\\r\\nyou are pleased to call ciphers, are no other than the Greek\\r\\ncharacters, in which, for my amusement, I keep a diary of everything\\r\\nremarkable that has occurred to my observation since the beginning of\\r\\nthe voyage, till the day in which I was put in irons; and the same\\r\\nmethod was practised by Mr. Thompson, who copied mine.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cA very likely\\r\\nstory,â\\x80\\x9d cried Mackshane; â\\x80\\x9cwhat occasion was there for using Greek\\r\\ncharacters, if you were not afraid of discovering what you had wrote?\\r\\nBut what dâ\\x80\\x99ye talk of Greek characters? Dâ\\x80\\x99ye think I am so ignorant of\\r\\nthe Greek language, as not to distinguish its letters from these, which\\r\\nare no more Greek than Chinese? No, no, I will not give up my knowledge\\r\\nof the Greek for you, nor none that ever came from your country.â\\x80\\x9d So\\r\\nsaying, with an unparalleled effrontery, he repeated some gibberish,\\r\\nwhich by the sound seemed to be Irish, and made it pass for Greek with\\r\\nthe captain, who, looking at me with a contemptuous sneer, exclaimed,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, ah! have you caught a tartar?â\\x80\\x9d I could not help smiling at the\\r\\nconsummate assurance of this Hibernian, and offered to refer the\\r\\ndispute to anybody on board who understood the Greek alphabet. Upon\\r\\nwhich Morgan was brought back, and, being made acquainted with the\\r\\naffair, took the book, and read a whole page in English, without\\r\\nhesitation, deciding the controversy in my favour. The doctor was so\\r\\nfar from being out of countenance at this detection, that he affirmed\\r\\nMorgan was in the secret, and repeated from his own invention. Oakum\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x9cAy, ay, I see they are both in a story;â\\x80\\x9d and dismissed my\\r\\nfellow-mate to his cockloft, although I proposed that he and I should\\r\\nread and translate, separately, any chapter or verse in the Greek\\r\\nTestament in his possession, by which it would appear whether we or the\\r\\nsurgeon spoke truth. Not being endued with eloquence enough to convince\\r\\nthe captain that there could be no juggle nor confederacy in this\\r\\nexpedient, I begged to be examined by some unconcerned person on board,\\r\\nwho understood Greek. Accordingly, the whole shipâ\\x80\\x99s company, officers\\r\\nand all, were called upon deck, among whom it was proclaimed that, if\\r\\nanyone of them could speak Greek, he or they so qualified should ascend\\r\\nthe quarter-deck immediately. After some pause, two foremast men came\\r\\nup, and professed their skill in that language, which, they said, they\\r\\nacquired during several voyages to the Levant, among the Greeks of the\\r\\nMorea. The captain exulted much in this declaration, and put my journal\\r\\nbook into the hands of one of them, who candidly owned he could neither\\r\\nread nor write; the other acknowledged the same degree of ignorance,\\r\\nbut pretended to speak the Greek lingo with any man on board; and,\\r\\naddressing himself to me, pronounced some sentences of a barbarous\\r\\ncorrupted language, which I did not understand. I asserted that the\\r\\nmodern Greek was as different from that spoken and written by the\\r\\nancients, as the English used now from the old Saxon spoke in the time\\r\\nof Hengist: and, as I had only learned the true original tongue, in\\r\\nwhich Homer, Pindar, the Evangelists, and other great men of antiquity\\r\\nwrote, it could not be supposed that I should know anything of an\\r\\nimperfect Gothic dialect that rose on the ruins of the former, and\\r\\nscarce retained any traces of the old expression: but, if Doctor\\r\\nMackshane, who pretended to be master of the Greek language, could\\r\\nmaintain a conversation with these seamen, I would retract what I had\\r\\nsaid, and be content to suffer any punishment be should think proper to\\r\\ninflict. I had no sooner uttered these words than the surgeon, knowing\\r\\none of the fellows to be his countryman, accosted him in Irish, and was\\r\\nanswered in the same brogue; then a dialogue ensued between them, which\\r\\nthey affirmed to be in Greek, after having secured the secrecy of the\\r\\nother tar, who had his cue in the language of the Morea, from his\\r\\ncompanion, before they would venture to assert such an intrepid\\r\\nfalsehood. â\\x80\\x9cI thought,â\\x80\\x9d said Oakum, â\\x80\\x9cwe should discover the imposture\\r\\nat last. Let the rascal be carried back to his confinement. I find he\\r\\nmust dangle.â\\x80\\x9d Having nothing further to urge in my own behalf, before a\\r\\ncourt so prejudiced with spite, and fortified with ignorance against\\r\\ntruth, I suffered myself to be reconducted peaceably to my\\r\\nfellow-prisoner, who, hearing the particulars of my trial, lifted up\\r\\nhis hands and eyes to Heaven, and uttered a dreadful groan: and, not\\r\\ndaring to disburden his thoughts to me by speech, lest he might be\\r\\noverheard by the sentinel, burst forth into a Welsh song, which he\\r\\naccompanied with a thousand contortions of face and violent gestures of\\r\\nbody.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI discover a subornation against me, by means of a quarrel between two\\r\\nof the evidences; in consequence of which I am set at liberty, and\\r\\nprevail upon Morgan to accept of his freedom on the same\\r\\ntermsâ\\x80\\x94Mackshaneâ\\x80\\x99s maliceâ\\x80\\x94we arrive at Jamaica, from whence in a short\\r\\ntime we beat up to Hispaniola, in conjunction with the West India\\r\\nsquadronâ\\x80\\x94we take in water, sail again, and arrive at\\r\\nCarthagenaâ\\x80\\x94Reflections on our conduct there\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, a quarrel happening between the two modern Greeks, the one,\\r\\nto be revenged of the other, came and discovered to us the mystery of\\r\\nMackshaneâ\\x80\\x99s dialogue, as I have explained it above. This detection\\r\\ncoming to the ears of the doctor, who was sensible that (now we were in\\r\\nsight of Jamaica) we should have an opportunity of clearing ourselves\\r\\nbefore a court-martial, and, at the same time, of making his malice and\\r\\nignorance conspicuous, he interceded for us with the captain so\\r\\neffectually, that in a few hours we were set at liberty, and ordered to\\r\\nreturn to our duty. This was a happy event for me, my whole body being\\r\\nblistered by the sun, and my limbs benumbed by want of motion: but I\\r\\ncould scarce persuade the Welshman to accept of this indulgence, he\\r\\npersisted in his obstinacy to remain in irons, until he should be\\r\\ndischarged by a court-martial, which, he believed would also do him\\r\\njustice on his enemies. At length I represented to him the precarious\\r\\nissue of a trial, the power and interest of his adversaries, and\\r\\nflattered his revenge with the hope of wreaking his resentment with his\\r\\nown hands upon Mackshane after our return to England. This last\\r\\nargument had more weight with him than all the rest, and prevailed upon\\r\\nhim to repair with me to the cockpit, which I no sooner entered, than\\r\\nthe idea of my departed friend presented itself to my remembrance, and\\r\\nfilled my eyes with tears. We discharged from our mess the boy who had\\r\\nacted so perfidiously, notwithstanding his tears, intreaties, and of\\r\\npenitence for what he had done; but not before he had confessed that\\r\\nthe surgeon had bribed him to give evidence against us, with a pair of\\r\\nstockings and a couple of old check shirts, of which his servant had\\r\\nsince plundered him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keys of our chests and lockers being sent to us by the doctor, we\\r\\ndetained the messenger until we had examined the contents; and my\\r\\nfellow-mate, finding all his Cheshire cheese consumed to a crust, his\\r\\nbrandy exhausted, and his onions gone, was seized with a fit of choler,\\r\\nwhich he discharged on Mackshaneâ\\x80\\x99s man in oaths and execrations,\\r\\nthreatening to prosecute him as a thief. The fellow swore in his turn,\\r\\nthat he never had the keys in his possession till that time, when he\\r\\nreceived them from his master with orders to deliver them to us. â\\x80\\x9cAs\\r\\nCot is my judge,â\\x80\\x9d cried Morgan, â\\x80\\x9cand my salfation, and my witness;\\r\\nwhosoever has pilfered my provisions is a lousy, peggarly, rascally\\r\\nknave! and by the soul of my grandsire, I will impeach, and accuse, and\\r\\nindict him, of a roppery, if I did but know who he is.â\\x80\\x9d Had this\\r\\nmisfortune happened at sea, where we could not repair the loss, in all\\r\\nprobability this descendant of Caractacus would have lost his wits\\r\\nentirely; but, when I observed how easy it would be to remedy this\\r\\npaltry mischance, he became more calm, and reconciled himself to the\\r\\noccasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little while after this transport the surgeon came into the birth,\\r\\nunder pretence of taking something out of the medicine chest, and, with\\r\\na smiling aspect, wished us joy of our deliverance, which, he said, he\\r\\nhad been at great pains to obtain of the captain, who was very justly\\r\\nincensed at our behaviour; but he, the doctor, had passed his word for\\r\\nour future conduct, and he hoped we should give him no cause to repent\\r\\nof his kindness. He expected, no doubt, an acknowledgment from us for\\r\\nthis pretended piece of service, as well as a general amnesty of what\\r\\nwas past; but he had to do with people who were not quite so apt to\\r\\nforgive injuries as he imagined, or to forget that, if our deliverance\\r\\nwas owing to his mediation, our calamity was occasioned by his malice;\\r\\nI therefore sat silent, while my companion answered, â\\x80\\x9cAy, ay, â\\x80\\x99tis no\\r\\nmatter, Cot knows the heart; there is a time for all things, as the\\r\\nwise man saith; there is a time for throwing away stones, and to gather\\r\\nthem up.â\\x80\\x9d He seemed to be disconcerted at this reply, and went away in\\r\\na pet, muttering something about â\\x80\\x9cIngratitude,â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cFellows,â\\x80\\x9d of which\\r\\nwe did not think fit to take any notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur fleet, having joined another that waited for us, lay at anchor\\r\\nabout a month in the harbour of Port Royal in Jamaica, during which\\r\\ntime something of consequence was certainly transacted; notwithstanding\\r\\nthe insinuations of some, who affirmed we had no business at all in\\r\\nthat place; that, in order to take the advantage of the season proper\\r\\nfor our enterprise, the West India squadron, which had previous notice\\r\\nof our coming, ought to have joined us at the west end of Hispaniola,\\r\\nwith necessary stores and refreshments, from whence we could have\\r\\nsailed directly for Carthagena, before the enemy could put themselves\\r\\nin a good posture of defence, or, indeed, have an inkling of our\\r\\ndesign. Be this as it will, we sailed from Jamaica, and, in ten days or\\r\\na fortnight, beat up against the wind as far as the Isle of Vache, with\\r\\nan intention, as was said, to attack the French fleet, then supposed to\\r\\nbe lying near that place; but before we arrived, they had sailed for\\r\\nEurope, having first dispatched an advice-boat to Carthagena, with an\\r\\naccount of our being in those seas, as also of our strength and\\r\\ndestination. We loitered here some days longer, taking in wood and\\r\\nbrackish water, in the use whereof, however, our admiral seemed to\\r\\nconsult the health of the men, by restricting each to a quart a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length we set sail, and arrived in a bay to the windward of\\r\\nCarthagena, where we came to an anchor, and lay at our ease ten days\\r\\nlonger. Here, again, certain malicious people took occasion to blame\\r\\nthe conduct of their superiors, by saying, that in so doing they not\\r\\nonly unprofitably wasted time, which was very precious, considering the\\r\\napproach of the rainy season, but also allowed the Spaniards to\\r\\nrecollect themselves from a terror occasioned by the approach of an\\r\\nEnglish fleet, at least three times as numerous as ever appeared in\\r\\nthat part of the world before. But if I might be allowed to give my\\r\\nopinion of the matter, I would ascribe this delay to the generosity of\\r\\nour chiefs, who scorned to take any advantage that fortune might give\\r\\nthem even over an enemy. At last, however, we weighed, and anchored\\r\\nagain somewhat nearer the harbourâ\\x80\\x99s mouth, where we made shift to land\\r\\nour marines, who encamped on the beach, in despite of the enemyâ\\x80\\x99s shot,\\r\\nwhich knocked a good many of them on the head. This piece of conduct,\\r\\nin choosing a camp under the walls of an enemyâ\\x80\\x99s fortification, which I\\r\\nbelieve never happened before, was practised, I presume, with a view of\\r\\naccustoming the soldiers to stand fire, who were not as yet much used\\r\\nto discipline, most of them having been taken from the plough-tail a\\r\\nfew months before. This expedient, again, has furnished matter for\\r\\ncensure against the ministry, for sending a few raw recruits on such an\\r\\nimportant enterprise, while so many veteran regiments lay inactive at\\r\\nhome. But surely our governors had their reasons for so doing, which\\r\\npossibly may be disclosed with other secrets of the deep. Perhaps they\\r\\nwere loth to risk their best troops on such desperate service, or the\\r\\ncolonel and the field officers of the old corps, who, generally\\r\\nspeaking, enjoyed their commissions as sinecures or pensions, for some\\r\\ndomestic services rendered to the court, refused to embark in such a\\r\\ndangerous and precarious undertaking; for which refusal, no doubt, they\\r\\nare to be much commended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Land Forces being disembarked, erect a fascine batteryâ\\x80\\x94our ship is\\r\\nordered, with four more, to batter the port of Bocca Chicaâ\\x80\\x94Mackshaneâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncowardiceâ\\x80\\x94the Chaplainâ\\x80\\x99s frenzyâ\\x80\\x94honest Rattlin loses one handâ\\x80\\x94his\\r\\nheroism and reflections on the battleâ\\x80\\x94Crampleyâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour to me during\\r\\nthe heat of the Fight\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur forces being landed and stationed as I have already mentioned, set\\r\\nabout erecting a fascine battery to cannonade the principal fort of the\\r\\nenemy; and in something more than three weeks, it was ready to open.\\r\\nThat we might do the Spaniards as much honour as possible, it was\\r\\ndetermined, in a council of war, that five of our largest ships should\\r\\nattack the fort on one side, while the battery, strengthened by two\\r\\nmortars and twenty-four cohorns, should ply it on the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, the signal for our ship to engage, among others, was\\r\\nhoisted, we being advertised, the night before, to make everything\\r\\nclear for that purpose; and, in so doing, a difference happened between\\r\\nCaptain Oakum and his well-beloved cousin and counsellor Mackshane,\\r\\nwhich had well nigh terminated in an open rupture. The doctor, who had\\r\\nimagined there was no more danger of being hurt by the enemyâ\\x80\\x99s shot in\\r\\nthe cockpit than in the centre of the earth, was lately informed that a\\r\\nsurgeonâ\\x80\\x99s mate had been killed in that part of the ship by a\\r\\ncannon-ball from two small redoubts that were destroyed before the\\r\\ndisembarkation of our soldiers; and therefore insisted upon having a\\r\\nplatform raised for the convenience of the sick and wounded in the\\r\\nafter-hold, where he deemed himself more secure than on the deck above.\\r\\nThe captain, offended at this extraordinary proposal, accused him of\\r\\npusillanimity, and told him, there was no room in the hold for such an\\r\\noccasion: or, if there was, he could not expect to be indulged more\\r\\nthan the rest of the surgeons of the navy, who used the cockpit for\\r\\nthat purpose. Fear rendering Mackshane obstinate, he persisted in his\\r\\ndemand, and showed his instructions, by which it was authorised; the\\r\\ncaptain swore these instructions were dictated by a parcel of lazy\\r\\npoltroons who were never at sea; nevertheless he was obliged to comply,\\r\\nand sent for the carpenter to give him orders about it. But, before any\\r\\nsuch measure could be taken, our signal was thrown out, and the doctor\\r\\ncompelled to trust his carcass in the cockpit, where Morgan and I were\\r\\nbusy in putting our instruments and dressings in order.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur ship, with others destined for this service, immediately weighed,\\r\\nand in less than half-an-hour came to an anchor before the castle of\\r\\nBocca Chica, with a spring upon our cable, and the cannonading (which\\r\\nindeed was dreadful) began. The surgeon, after having crossed himself,\\r\\nfell flat on the deck; and the chaplain and purser, who were stationed\\r\\nwith us in quality of assistants, followed his example, while the\\r\\nWelshman and I sat upon a chest looking at one another with great\\r\\ndiscomposure, scarce able to refrain from the like prostration. And\\r\\nthat the reader may know it was not a common occasion that alarmed us\\r\\nthus, I must inform him of the particulars of this dreadful din that\\r\\nastonished us. The fire of the Spaniards proceeded from eighty-four\\r\\ngreat guns, besides a mortar and small arms, in Bocca Chica; thirty-six\\r\\nin Fort St. Joseph; twenty in two fascine batteries, and four\\r\\nmen-of-war, mounting sixty-four guns each. This was answered by our\\r\\nland-battery mounted with twenty-one cannon, two mortars, and\\r\\ntwenty-four cohorns, and five great ships of seventy or eighty guns,\\r\\nthat fired without intermission.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had not been many minutes engaged, when one of the sailors brought\\r\\nanother on his back to the cockpit, where he tossed him down like a bag\\r\\nof oats, and pulling out his pouch, put a large chew of tobacco in his\\r\\nmouth without speaking a word. Morgan immediately examined the\\r\\ncondition of the wounded man, and cried out, â\\x80\\x9cAs I shall answer now,\\r\\nthe man is as dead as my great grandfather.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDead,â\\x80\\x9d said his comrade;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9che may be dead now, for aught I know, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be dâ\\x80\\x94d if he was not\\r\\nalive when I took him up.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he was about to return to his\\r\\nquarters, when I bade him carry the body along with him, and throw it\\r\\noverboard. â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n the body!â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI think â\\x80\\x99tis fair enough if I take\\r\\ncare of my own.â\\x80\\x9d My fellow mate, snatching up the amputation knife,\\r\\npursued him half-way up the cock-pit ladder, crying, â\\x80\\x9cYou lousy rascal,\\r\\nis this the churchyard, or the charnel-house, or the sepulchre, or the\\r\\ngolgotha, of the ship?â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94but was stopped in his career by one calling,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYo he, avast thereâ\\x80\\x94scaldings!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cScaldings!â\\x80\\x9d answered Morgan; â\\x80\\x9cCot\\r\\nknows â\\x80\\x99tis hot enough indeed: who are you?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80\\x99s one!â\\x80\\x9d replied the\\r\\nvoice; and I immediately knew it to be that of my honest friend Jack\\r\\nRattlin, who coming towards me, told me, with great deliberation, he\\r\\nwas come to be docked at last, and discovered the remains of one hand,\\r\\nwhich had been shattered to pieces with a grape shot. I lamented with\\r\\nunfeigned sorrow his misfortune, which he bore with heroic courage,\\r\\nobserving, that every shot had its commission: â\\x80\\x9cIt was well it did not\\r\\ntake him in the head! or if it had, what then? he should have died\\r\\nbravely, fighting for his king and country. Death was a debt which\\r\\nevery man owed, and must pay; and that now was as well as another\\r\\ntime.â\\x80\\x9d I was much pleased and edified with the maxims of this\\r\\nsea-philosopher, who endured the amputation of his left hand without\\r\\nshrinking, the operation being performed (at his request) by me, after\\r\\nMackshane, who was with difficulty prevailed to lift his head from the\\r\\ndeck, had declared there was a necessity for his losing the limb.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I was employed in dressing the stump, I asked Jackâ\\x80\\x99s opinion of\\r\\nthe battle, who, shaking his head, frankly told me, he believed we\\r\\nshould do no good: â\\x80\\x9cFor why? because, instead of dropping anchor close\\r\\nunder shore, where we should have to deal with one corner of Bocca\\r\\nChica only, we had opened the harbour, and exposed ourselves to the\\r\\nwhole fire of the enemy from their shipping and Fort St. Joseph, as\\r\\nwell as from the castle we intended to cannonade; that, besides, we lay\\r\\nat too great a distance to damage the walls, and three parts in four of\\r\\nour shot did not take place; for there was scarce anybody on board who\\r\\nunderstood the pointing of a gun. Ah! God help us!â\\x80\\x9d continued he, â\\x80\\x9cIf\\r\\nyour kinsman, Lieutenant Bowling, had been here, we should have had\\r\\nother guess work.â\\x80\\x9d By this time, our patients had increased to such a\\r\\nnumber, that we did not know which to begin with; and the first mate\\r\\nplainly told the surgeon, that if he did not get up immediately and\\r\\nperform his duty, he would complain of his behaviour to the admiral,\\r\\nand make application for his warrant. This remonstrance effectually\\r\\nroused Mackshane, who was never deaf to an argument in which he thought\\r\\nhis interest was concerned; he therefore rose up, and in order to\\r\\nstrengthen his resolution, had recourse more than once to a case-bottle\\r\\nof rum, which he freely communicated to the chaplain, and purser, who\\r\\nhad as much need of such extraordinary inspiration as himself. Being\\r\\nthus supported, he went to work, and arms and legs were hewed down\\r\\nwithout mercy. The fumes of the liquor mounting into the parsonâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbrain, conspired, with his former agitation of spirits, to make him\\r\\nquite delirious; he stripped himself to the skin; and, besmearing his\\r\\nbody with blood, could scarce be withheld from running upon deck in\\r\\nthat condition. Jack Rattlin, scandalised at this deportment,\\r\\nendeavoured to allay his transports with reason; but finding all he\\r\\nsaid ineffectual, and great confusion occasioned by his frolics, he\\r\\nknocked him down with his right hand, and by threats kept him quiet in\\r\\nthat state of humiliation. But it was not in the power of rum to\\r\\nelevate the purser, who sat on the floor wringing his hands, and\\r\\ncursing the hour in which he left his peaceable profession of a brewer\\r\\nin Rochester, to engage in such a life of terror and disquiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we diverted ourselves at the expense of this poor devil, a shot\\r\\nhappened to take us between wind and water, and (its course being\\r\\nthrough the purserâ\\x80\\x99s store room) made a terrible havoc and noise among\\r\\nthe jars and bottles in its way, and disconcerted Mackshane so much,\\r\\nthat he dropped his scalpel, and falling down on his knees, pronounced\\r\\nhis Pater-noster aloud: the purser fell backward, and lay without sense\\r\\nor motion; and the chaplain grew so outrageous, that Rattlin with one\\r\\nhand could not keep him under; so that we were obliged to confine him\\r\\nin the surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s cabin, where he was no doubt guilty of a thousand\\r\\nextravagancies. Much about this time, my old antagonist, Crampley, came\\r\\ndown, with express orders, as he said, to bring me up to the\\r\\nquarter-deck, to dress a slight wound the captain had received by a\\r\\nsplinter: his reason for honouring me in particular with this piece of\\r\\nservice, being, that in case I should be killed or disabled by the way,\\r\\nmy death or mutilation would be of less consequence to the shipâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncompany than that of the doctor or his first mate. At another time,\\r\\nperhaps, I might have disputed this order, to which I was not bound to\\r\\npay the least regard; but as I thought my reputation depended upon my\\r\\ncompliance, I was resolved to convince my rival that I was no more\\r\\nafraid than he of exposing myself to danger. With this view I provided\\r\\nmyself with dressings, and followed him immediately to the\\r\\nquarter-deck, through a most infernal scene of slaughter, fire, smoke,\\r\\nand uproar. Captain Oakum, who leaned against the mizen-mast, no sooner\\r\\nsaw me approach in my shirt, with the sleeves tucked up to my armpits,\\r\\nand my hands dyed with blood, than he signified his displeasure by a\\r\\nfrown, and asked why the doctor himself did not come? I told him that\\r\\nCrampley had singled me out, as if by express command; at which reply\\r\\nhe seemed surprised, and threatened to punish the midshipman for his\\r\\npresumption, after the engagement. In the meantime, I was sent back to\\r\\nmy station, and ordered to tell Mackshane, that the captain expected\\r\\nhim immediately. I got safe back, and delivered my commission to the\\r\\ndoctor, who flatly refused to quit the post assigned to him by his\\r\\ninstructions; whereupon Morgan, who I believe, was jealous of my\\r\\nreputation for courage, undertook the affair, and ascended with great\\r\\nintrepidity. The captain, finding the surgeon obstinate, suffered\\r\\nhimself to be dressed, and swore he would confine Mackshane as soon as\\r\\nthe service should be over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA breach being made in the walls, our soldiers give the assault, and\\r\\ntake the place without oppositionâ\\x80\\x94our sailors at the same time, become\\r\\nmasters of all the other strengths near Bocca Chica, and take\\r\\npossession of the harbourâ\\x80\\x94the good consequence of this successâ\\x80\\x94we move\\r\\nnearer the townâ\\x80\\x94find two forts deserted, and the Channel blocked up\\r\\nwith sunk vessels; which however we find means to clearâ\\x80\\x94land our\\r\\nsoldiers at La Quintaâ\\x80\\x94repulse a body of militiaâ\\x80\\x94attack the castle of\\r\\nSt. Lazar, and are forced to retreat with great lossâ\\x80\\x94the remains of our\\r\\narmy are re-embarkedâ\\x80\\x94an effort of the Admiral to take the townâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\neconomy of our expedition described\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving cannonaded the fort during the space of four hours, we were all\\r\\nordered to slip our cables, and sheer off; but next day the engagement\\r\\nwas renewed, and continued from the morning till the afternoon, when\\r\\nthe enemyâ\\x80\\x99s fire from Bocca Chica slackened, and towards evening was\\r\\nquite silenced. A breach being made on the other side, by our land\\r\\nbattery, large enough to admit a middle-sized baboon, provided he could\\r\\nfind means to climb up to it, our general proposed to give the assault\\r\\nthat very night, and actually ordered a detachment on that duty.\\r\\nProvidence stood our friend upon this occasion, and put it into the\\r\\nhearts of the Spaniards to abandon the fort, which might have been\\r\\nmaintained by resolute men till the day of judgment against all the\\r\\nforce we could exert in the attack. And while our soldiers took\\r\\npossession of the enemyâ\\x80\\x99s ramparts without resistance, the same good\\r\\nluck attended a body of sailors, who made themselves masters of Fort\\r\\nSt. Joseph, the fascine batteries, and one Spanish man-of-war; the\\r\\nother three being burnt or sunk by the foe, that they might not fall\\r\\ninto our hands. The taking of these forts, in the strength of which the\\r\\nSpaniards chiefly confided, made us masters of the outward harbour, and\\r\\noccasioned great joy among us, as we laid our accounts at finding\\r\\nlittle or no opposition from the town: and indeed, if a few great ships\\r\\nhad sailed up immediately, before they had recovered from the confusion\\r\\nand despair that our unexpected success had produced among them, it is\\r\\nnot impossible that we might have finished the affair to our\\r\\nsatisfaction, without any more bloodshed; but this step our heroes\\r\\ndisdained as a barbarous insult over the enemyâ\\x80\\x99s distress, and gave\\r\\nthem all the respite they could desire, in order to recollect\\r\\nthemselves. In the meantime, Mackshane, taking the advantage of this\\r\\ngeneral exultation, waited on our captain, and pleaded his own cause so\\r\\neffectually that he was re-established in his good graces; and as for\\r\\nCrampley, there was no more notice taken of his behaviour towards me\\r\\nduring the action. But of all the consequences of the victory, none was\\r\\nmore grateful than plenty of fresh water, after we had languished five\\r\\nweeks on the allowance of a purserâ\\x80\\x99s quart per day for each man in the\\r\\nTorrid Zone, where the sun was vertical, and the expense of bodily\\r\\nfluid so great, that a gallon of liquor could scarce supply the waste\\r\\nof twenty-four hours; especially as our provision consisted of putrid\\r\\nsalt beef, to which the sailors gave the name of Irish horse; salt\\r\\npork, of New England, which, though neither fish nor flesh, savoured of\\r\\nboth; bread from the same country, every biscuit whereof, like a piece\\r\\nof clockwork, moved by its own internal impulse, occasioned by the\\r\\nmyriads of insects that dwelt within it; and butter served out by the\\r\\ngill, that tasted like train oil thickened with salt. Instead of small\\r\\nbeer, each man was allowed three half-quarterns of brandy or rum, which\\r\\nwere distributed every morning, diluted with a certain quantity of his\\r\\nwater, without either sugar or fruit to render it palatable, for which\\r\\nreason, this composition was by the sailors not ineptly styled\\r\\nNecessity. Nor was this limitation of simple element owing to a\\r\\nscarcity of it on board, for there was at this time water enough in the\\r\\nship for a voyage of six months, at the rate of half-a-gallon per day\\r\\nto each man: but this fast must, I suppose, have been enjoined by way\\r\\nof penance on the shipâ\\x80\\x99s company for their sins; or rather with a view\\r\\nto mortify them into a contempt of life, that they might thereby become\\r\\nmore resolute and regardless of danger. How simply then do those people\\r\\nargue, who ascribe the great mortality among us, to our bad provision\\r\\nand want of water; and affirm, that a great many valuable lives might\\r\\nhave been saved, if the useless transports had been employed in\\r\\nfetching fresh stock, turtle, fruit, and other refreshments from\\r\\nJamaica and other adjacent islands, for the use of the army and fleet!\\r\\nseeing it is to be hoped, that those who died went to a better place,\\r\\nand those who survived were the more easily maintained. After all, a\\r\\nsufficient number remained to fall before the walls of St. Lazar, where\\r\\nthey behaved like their own country mastiffs, which shut their eyes,\\r\\nrun into the jaws of a bear, and have their heads crushed for their\\r\\nvalour.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to return to my narration. After having put garrisons into the\\r\\nforts we had taken, and re-embarked our soldiers and artillery (a piece\\r\\nof service that detained us more than a week), we ventured up to the\\r\\nmouth of the inner harbour, guarded by a large fortification on one\\r\\nside, and a small redoubt on the other, both of which were deserted\\r\\nbefore our approach, and the entrance of the harbour blocked up by\\r\\nseveral old galleons, and two men-of-war that the enemy had sunk in the\\r\\nchannel. We made shift, however, to open a passage for some ships, that\\r\\nfavoured a second landing of our troops at a place called La Quinta,\\r\\nnot far from the town, where, after a faint resistance from a body of\\r\\nSpaniards, who opposed their disembarkation, they encamped with a\\r\\ndesign of besieging the castle of St. Lazar, which overlooked and\\r\\ncommanded the city. Whether our renowned general had nobody in his army\\r\\nwho knew how to approach it in form, or that he trusted entirely to the\\r\\nfame of his arms, I shall not determine; but, certain it is, a\\r\\nresolution was taken in a council of war, to attack the place with\\r\\nmusketry only. This was put in execution, and succeeded accordingly;\\r\\nthe enemy giving them such a hearty reception, that the greatest part\\r\\nof their detachment took up their everlasting residence on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur chief, not relishing this kind of complaisance in the Spaniardâ\\x80\\x99s,\\r\\nwas wise enough to retreat on board with the remains of his army,\\r\\nwhich, from eight thousand able men landed on the beach near Bocca\\r\\nChica, was now reduced to fifteen hundred fit for service. The sick and\\r\\nwounded were squeezed into certain vessels, which thence obtained the\\r\\nname of hospital ships, though methinks they scarce deserved such a\\r\\ncreditable title, seeing few of them could boast of their surgeon,\\r\\nnurse, or cook; and the space between decks was so confined that the\\r\\nmiserable patients had not room to sit upright in their beds. Their\\r\\nwounds and stumps, being neglected, contracted filth and putrefaction,\\r\\nand millions of maggots were hatched amidst the corruption of their\\r\\nsores. This inhuman disregard was imputed to the scarcity of surgeons;\\r\\nthough it is well known that every great ship in the fleet could have\\r\\nspared one at least for this duty, an expedient which would have been\\r\\nmore than sufficient to remove this shocking inconvenience. But perhaps\\r\\nour general was too much of a gentleman to ask a favour of this kind\\r\\nfrom his fellow chief, who, on the other hand, would not derogate so\\r\\nmuch from his own dignity, as to offer such assistance unasked; for, I\\r\\nmay venture to affirm, that by this time the Demon of Discord, with her\\r\\nsooty wings, had breathed her influence upon our councils; and it might\\r\\nbe said of these great men (I hope they will pardon the comparison) as\\r\\nof Cesar and Pompey, the one could not brook a superior, and the other\\r\\nwas impatient of an equal; so that, between the pride of one and\\r\\ninsolence of another, the enterprise miscarried, according to the\\r\\nproverb, â\\x80\\x9cBetween two stools the backside falls to the ground.â\\x80\\x9d Not\\r\\nthat I would be thought to liken any public concern to that opprobrious\\r\\npart of the human body, though I might with truth assert, if I durst\\r\\nuse such a vulgar idiom, that the nation did hang on arse at its\\r\\ndisappointment on this occasion; neither would I presume to compare the\\r\\ncapacity of our heroic leaders to any such wooden convenience as a\\r\\njoint-stool or a close-stool; but only to signify by this simile, the\\r\\nmistake the people committed in trusting to the union of two\\r\\ninstruments that were never joined.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day or two after the attempt on St. Lazar, the admiral ordered one of\\r\\nthe Spanish men-of-war we had taken to be mounted with sixteen guns,\\r\\nand manned with detachments from our great ships, in order to batter\\r\\nthe town; accordingly, she was towed into the inner harbour in the\\r\\nnight, and moored within half a mile of the walls, against which she\\r\\nbegan to fire at daybreak; and continued about six hours exposed to the\\r\\nopposition of at least thirty pieces of cannon, which at length obliged\\r\\nour men to set her on fire, and get off as well as they could in their\\r\\nboats. This piece of conduct afforded matter of speculation to all the\\r\\nwits, either in the army or navy, who were at last fain to acknowledge\\r\\nit a stroke of policy above their comprehension. Some entertained such\\r\\nan irreverent opinion of the admiralâ\\x80\\x99s understanding, as to think he\\r\\nexpected the town would surrender to his floating battery of sixteen\\r\\nguns: others imagined his sole intention was to try the enemyâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nstrength, by which he should be able to compute the number of great\\r\\nships that would be necessary to force the town to a capitulation. But\\r\\nthis last conjecture soon appeared groundless, inasmuch as no ships of\\r\\nany kind whatever were afterwards employed on that service. A third\\r\\nsort swore, that no other cause could be assigned for this undertaking\\r\\nthan that which induced Don Quixote to attack the windmill. A fourth\\r\\nclass (and that the most numerous, though, without doubt, composed of\\r\\nthe sanguine and malicious), plainly taxed this commander with want of\\r\\nhonesty as well as sense; and alleged that he ought to have sacrificed\\r\\nprivate pique to the interest of his country; that, where the lives of\\r\\nso many brave fellow-citizens were concerned, he ought to have\\r\\nconcurred with the general without being solicited or even desired,\\r\\ntowards their preservation and advantage, that, if his arguments could\\r\\nnot dissuade him from a desperate enterprise, it was his duty to have\\r\\nrendered it as practicable as possible, without running extreme hazard;\\r\\nthat this could have been done, with a good prospect of success, by\\r\\nordering five or six large ships to batter the town, while the land\\r\\nforces stormed the castle; by these means a considerable diversion\\r\\nwould have been made in favour of those troops, who, in their march to\\r\\nthe assault and in the retreat, suffered much more from the town than\\r\\nfrom the castle! that the inhabitants, seeing themselves vigorously\\r\\nattacked on all hands, would have been divided, distracted, and\\r\\nconfused, and in all probability, unable to resist the assailants. But\\r\\nall these suggestions surely proceeded from ignorance or malevolence,\\r\\nor else the admiral would not have found it such an easy matter, at his\\r\\nreturn to England, to justify his conduct to a ministry at once so\\r\\nupright and discerning. True it is, that those who undertook to\\r\\nvindicate him on the spot, asserted, that there was not water enough\\r\\nfor our great ships near the town: though this was a little\\r\\nunfortunately urged, because there happened to be pilots in the fleet\\r\\nperfectly well acquainted with the soundings of the harbour, who\\r\\naffirmed there was water enough for five eighty-gun ships to lie\\r\\nabreast almost up to the very walls. The disappointments we suffered\\r\\noccasioned a universal dejection, which was not at all alleviated by\\r\\nthe objects that daily and hourly entertained our eyes, nor by the\\r\\nprospect of what must have inevitably happened, had we remained much\\r\\nlonger in this place. Such was the economy in some ships that, rather\\r\\nthan be at the trouble of interring the dead, their commanders ordered\\r\\ntheir men to throw their bodies overboard, many without either ballast\\r\\nor winding-sheet; so that numbers of human carcases floated in the\\r\\nharbour, until they were devoured by sharks and carrion crows, which\\r\\nafforded no agreeable spectacle to those who survived. At the same time\\r\\nthe wet season began, during which a deluge of rain falls, from the\\r\\nrising to the setting sun, without intermission, and that no sooner\\r\\nceases than it begins to thunder, and lighten with such continued\\r\\nflashing, that one can see to read a very small print by the\\r\\nillumination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn epidemic Fever rages among usâ\\x80\\x94we abandon our Conquestsâ\\x80\\x94I am seized\\r\\nwith Distemperâ\\x80\\x94write a Petition to the Captain, which is rejectedâ\\x80\\x94I am\\r\\nin danger of Suffocation through the Malice of Crampley, and relieved\\r\\nby a Serjeantâ\\x80\\x94my Fever increasesâ\\x80\\x94the Chaplain wants to confess meâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nobtain a favourable Crisisâ\\x80\\x94Morganâ\\x80\\x99s Affection for me provedâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nBehaviour of Mackshane and Crampley towards meâ\\x80\\x94Captain Oakum is removed\\r\\ninto another Ship with his beloved Doctorâ\\x80\\x94our new Captain describedâ\\x80\\x94An\\r\\nAdventure of Morgan\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe change of the atmosphere, occasioned by this phenomenon, conspired,\\r\\nwith the stench that surrounded us, the heat of the climate, our own\\r\\nconstitutions, impoverished by bad provisions, and our despair, to\\r\\nintroduce the bilious fever among us, which raged with such violence,\\r\\nthat three-fourths of those whom it invaded died in a deplorable\\r\\nmanner; the colour of their skin being, by the extreme putrefaction of\\r\\nthe juices, changed into that of soot.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur conductors, finding things in this situation, perceived it was high\\r\\nto relinquish our conquests, and this we did, after having rendered\\r\\ntheir artillery useless, and blown up their walls with gunpowder. Just\\r\\nas we sailed from Bocca Chica, on our return to Jamaica, I found myself\\r\\nthreatened with the symptoms of this terrible distemper; and knowing\\r\\nvery well that I stood no chance for my life, if I should be obliged to\\r\\nbe in the cockpit, which by this time was grown intolerable, even to\\r\\npeople in health, by reason of the heat and unwholesome smell of\\r\\ndecayed provision, I wrote a petition to the captain, representing my\\r\\ncase, and humbly imploring his permission to be among the soldiers in\\r\\nthe middle deck, for the benefit of the air: but I might have spared\\r\\nmyself the trouble; for this humane commander refused my request, and\\r\\nordered me to continue in the place allotted for the surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s mates,\\r\\nor else be contented to be in the hospital, which, by the by, was three\\r\\ndegrees more offensive and more suffocating than our own berth below.\\r\\nAnother, in my condition, perhaps, would have submitted to his fate,\\r\\nand died in a pet; but I could not brook the thought of perishing so\\r\\npitifully, after I had weathered so many gales of hard fortune: I\\r\\ntherefore, without minding Oakumâ\\x80\\x99s injunction, prevailed upon the\\r\\nsoldiers (whose good-will I had acquired) to admit my hammock among\\r\\nthem; and actually congratulated myself upon my comfortable situation;\\r\\nwhich Crampley no sooner understood, than he signified to the captain\\r\\nmy contempt of his orders, and was invested with power to turn me down\\r\\nagain into my proper habitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis barbarous piece of revenge incensed me so much against the author,\\r\\nthat I vowed, with bitter imprecations, to call him to a severe\\r\\naccount, if ever it should be in my power; and the agitation of my\\r\\nspirits increased my fever to a violent degree. While I lay gasping for\\r\\nbreath in this infernal abode, I was visited by a sergeant, the bones\\r\\nof whose nose I had reduced and set to rights, after they had been\\r\\ndemolished by a splinter during our last engagement; he, being informed\\r\\nof my condition, offered me the use of his berth in the middle deck,\\r\\nwhich was enclosed with canvas, and well aired by a port-hole that\\r\\nremained open within it. I embraced this proposal with joy, and was\\r\\nimmediately conducted to the place, where I was treated, while my\\r\\nillness lasted, with the utmost tenderness and care by this grateful\\r\\nhalberdier, who had no other bed for himself than a hencoop during the\\r\\nwhole passage. Here I lay and enjoyed the breeze, notwithstanding which\\r\\nmy malady gained ground, and at length my life was despaired of, though\\r\\nI never lost hopes of recovery, even when I had the mortification to\\r\\nsee, from my cabin-window, six or seven thrown overboard every day, who\\r\\ndied of the same distemper. This confidence, I am persuaded, conduced a\\r\\ngreat deal to the preservation of my life, especially when joined to\\r\\nanother resolution I took at the beginning, namely, to refuse all\\r\\nmedicine, which I could not help thinking co-operated with the disease,\\r\\nand, instead of resisting putrefaction, promoted a total degeneracy of\\r\\nthe vital fluid. When my friend Morgan, therefore, brought his\\r\\ndiaphoretic bolases, I put them into my mouth, â\\x80\\x99tis true, but without\\r\\nany intention of swallowing them: and, when he went away, spit them\\r\\nout, and washed my mouth with water-gruel. I seemingly complied in this\\r\\nmatter, that I might not affront the blood of Caractacus, by a refusal\\r\\nwhich might have intimated a diffidence of his physical capacity, for\\r\\nhe acted as my physician; Doctor Mackshane never once inquiring about\\r\\nme, or even knowing where I was. When my distemper was at the height,\\r\\nMorgan thought my case desperate, and, after having applied a blister\\r\\nto the nape of my neck, squeezed my hand, bidding me, with a woful\\r\\ncountenance, recommend myself to Cot and my Reteemer; then, taking his\\r\\nleave, desired the chaplain to come and administer some spiritual\\r\\nconsolation to me; but, before he arrived, I made shift to rid myself\\r\\nof the troublesome application the Welshman had bestowed on my back.\\r\\nThe person, having felt my pulse, inquired into the nature of my\\r\\ncomplaints, hemmed a little, and began thus: â\\x80\\x9cMr. Random, God out of\\r\\nhis infinite mercy has been pleased to visit you with a dreadful\\r\\ndistemper, the issue of which no man knows. You may be permitted to\\r\\nrecover and live many days on the face of the earth; and, which is more\\r\\nprobable, you may be taken away, and cut off in the flower of your\\r\\nyouth. It is incumbent on you, therefore, to prepare for the great\\r\\nchange, by repenting sincerely of your sins; of this there cannot be a\\r\\ngreater sign, than an ingenuous confession, which I conjure you to make\\r\\nwithout hesitation or mental reservation; and, when I am convinced of\\r\\nyour sincerity, I will then give you such comfort as the situation of\\r\\nyour soul will admit of. Without doubt, you have been guilty of\\r\\nnumberless transgressions to which youth is subject, as swearing,\\r\\ndrunkenness, whoredom, and adultery: tell me therefore, without\\r\\nreserve, the particulars of each, especially of the last, that I may be\\r\\nacquainted with the true state of your conscience; for no physician\\r\\nwill prescribe for his patient until he knows the circumstances of his\\r\\ndisease.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was not under any apprehensions of death, I could not help smiling\\r\\nat the chaplainâ\\x80\\x99s inquisitive remonstrance, which I told him savoured\\r\\nmore of the Roman than of the Protestant church, in recommending\\r\\nauricular confession; a thing, in my opinion, not at all necessary to\\r\\nsalvation, and which, for that reason, I declined. This reply\\r\\ndisconcerted him a little; however, he explained away his meaning, in\\r\\nmaking learned distinctions between what was absolutely necessary and\\r\\nwhat was only convenient; then proceeded to ask what religion I\\r\\nprofessed. I answered, that I had not as yet considered the difference\\r\\nof religions, consequently had not fixed on any one in particular, but\\r\\nthat I was bred a Presbyterian. At this word the chaplain expressed\\r\\ngreat astonishment, and said, he could not comprehend how a\\r\\npresbyterian was entitled to any post under the English government.\\r\\nThen he asked if I had ever received the sacrament, or taken the oaths;\\r\\nto which questions, I replying in the negative, he held up his hands,\\r\\nassured me he could do me no service, wished I might not be in a state\\r\\nof reprobation, and returned to his messmates, who were making merry in\\r\\nthe ward-room, round a table well stored with bumbo(2) and wine.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2)bumbo is a liquor composed of rum, sugar, water, and nutmeg\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis insinuation, terrible as it was, had not such an effect upon me as\\r\\nthe fever, which, soon after he had left me, grew outrageous. I began\\r\\nto see strange chimeras and concluded myself upon the point of being\\r\\ndelirious; in the meantime, being in great danger of suffocation, I\\r\\nstarted up in a kind of frantic fit, with an intention to plunge myself\\r\\ninto the sea; and, as my friend the sergeant was not present, would\\r\\ncertainly have cooled myself to some purpose, had I not perceived a\\r\\nmoisture upon my thigh, as I endeavoured to get out of my hammock: the\\r\\nappearance of this revived my hopes, and I had reflection and\\r\\nresolution enough to take the advantage of this favourable symptom, by\\r\\ntearing the shirt from my body, and the sheets from my bed, and\\r\\nwrapping myself in a thick blanket, in which inclosure, for about a\\r\\nquarter of an hour, felt all the pains of hell: but it was not long\\r\\nbefore I was recompensed for my suffering by a profuse sweat, that,\\r\\nbursting from the whole surface of my skin, in less than two hours,\\r\\nrelieved me from all my complaints except that of weakness; and left me\\r\\nas hungry as a kite. I enjoyed a very comfortable nap, after which I\\r\\nwas regaling myself with the agreeable reverie of future happiness,\\r\\nwhen I heard Morgan, on the outside of the curtain, ask the sergeant if\\r\\nI was alive still? â\\x80\\x9cAlive!â\\x80\\x9d cried the other, â\\x80\\x9cGod forbid he should be\\r\\notherwise! he has lain quiet these five hours, and I do not choose to\\r\\ndisturb him, for sleep will do him great service.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said my\\r\\nfellow-mate, â\\x80\\x9che sleeps so sound (look you), that he will not waken\\r\\ntill the great trump plowsâ\\x80\\x94Cot be merciful to his soul. He has paid his\\r\\ndebt like an honest manâ\\x80\\x94ay, and moreover, he is at rest from all\\r\\npersecutions, and troubles, and afflictions, of which, Cot knows, and I\\r\\nknow, he had his own shareâ\\x80\\x94Ochree! Ochree! he was a promising youth\\r\\nindeed!â\\x80\\x9d So saying he groaned grievously, and began to whine in such a\\r\\nmanner, as persuaded me he had a real friendship for me. The sergeant,\\r\\nalarmed at his words, came into the berth, and, while he looked upon\\r\\nme, I smiled, and tipped him the wink: he immediately guessed my\\r\\nmeaning and remaining silent, Morgan was confirmed in his opinion of my\\r\\nbeing dead; whereupon he approached, with tears in his eyes, in order\\r\\nto indulge his grief with a sight of the object: and I counterfeited\\r\\ndeath so well, by fixing my eyes and dropping my under-jaw, that he\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x9cThere he lies, no petter than a lump of clay, Cot help me!â\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\nobserved, by the distortion of my face, that I must have had a strong\\r\\nstruggle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should not have been able to contain myself much longer, when he\\r\\nbegan to perform the last duty of a friend, in closing my eyes and my\\r\\nmouth, upon which I suddenly snapped at his fingers and discomposed him\\r\\nso much that he started back, turned pale as ashes, and stared like the\\r\\npicture of horror; although I could not help laughing at his\\r\\nappearance, I was concerned for his situation, and stretched out my\\r\\nhand, telling him I hoped to live and eat some salmagundy of his making\\r\\nin England. It was some time before he could recollect himself so far\\r\\nas to feel my pulse, and inquire into the particulars of my disease;\\r\\nbut when he found I had enjoyed a favourable crisis, he congratulated\\r\\nme upon my good fortune; not failing to ascribe it, under Cot, to the\\r\\nblister he had applied to my back, at his last visit; which, by the\\r\\nbye, said he, must now be removed and dressed; he was actually going to\\r\\nfetch dressings, when I, feigning astonishment, said, â\\x80\\x9cBless me! sure\\r\\nyou never applied a blister to meâ\\x80\\x94there is nothing on my back, I assure\\r\\nyou.â\\x80\\x9d But he could not be convinced till he had examined it, and then\\r\\nendeavoured to conceal his confusion, by expressing his surprise in\\r\\nfinding the skin untouched and the plaster missing. In order to excuse\\r\\nmyself for paying so little regard to his prescription, I pretended to\\r\\nhave been insensible when it was put on, and to have pulled it off\\r\\nafterwards in a fit of delirium. This apology satisfied my friend, who,\\r\\non this occasion, abated a good deal of his stiffness in regard to\\r\\npunctilio; and as we were now safely arrived at Jamaica, where I had\\r\\nthe benefit of fresh provisions and other refreshments, I recovered\\r\\nstrength every day, and, in a short time, my health and vigour were\\r\\nperfectly re-established.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I got up at first, and was just able to crawl about the deck with\\r\\na staff in my hand, I met Doctor Mackshane, who passed by me with a\\r\\ndisdainful look, and did not vouchsafe to honour me with one word.\\r\\nAfter him came Crampley, who, strutting up to me with a fierce\\r\\ncountenance, pronounced, â\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80\\x99s fine discipline on-board, when such\\r\\nlazy, skulking sons of bitches as you are allowed, on pretence of\\r\\nsickness, to lollop at your ease, while your betters are kept to hard\\r\\nduty!â\\x80\\x9d The sight and behaviour of this malicious scoundrel enraged me\\r\\nso much that I could scarce refrain from laying my cudgel across his\\r\\npate; but when I considered my present feebleness, and the enemies I\\r\\nhad in the ship, who wanted only a pretence to ruin me, I restrained my\\r\\npassion, and contented myself with telling him, I had not forgot his\\r\\ninsolence and malice, and that I hoped we should meet one day on shore.\\r\\nAt this declaration he grinned, shook his fist, and swore he longed for\\r\\nnothing more than such an opportunity. Meanwhile our ship was ordered\\r\\nto be heaved down, victualled, and watered, for her return to England;\\r\\nand our captain, for some reason or other, not thinking it convenient\\r\\nfor him to revisit his native country at this time, exchanged with a\\r\\ngentleman, who, on the other hand, wished for nothing so much as to be\\r\\nsafe without the tropic: all his care and tenderness of himself being\\r\\ninsufficient to preserve his complexion from the injuries of the sun\\r\\nand weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur tyrant having left the ship, and carried his favourite Mackshane\\r\\nalong with him, to my inexpressible satisfaction, our new commander\\r\\ncame on board in a ten-oared barge, overshadowed with a vast umbrella,\\r\\nand appeared in everything the reverse of Oakum, being a tall, thin\\r\\nyoung man, dressed in this manner: a white hat, garnished with a red\\r\\nfeather, adorned his head, from whence his hair flowed upon his\\r\\nshoulders, in ringlets tied behind with a ribbon. His coat, consisting\\r\\nof pink-coloured silk, lined with white, by the elegance of the cut\\r\\nretired backward, as it were, to discover a white satin waistcoat\\r\\nembroidered with gold, unbuttoned at the upper part to display a brooch\\r\\nset with garnets, that glittered in the breast of his shirt, which was\\r\\nof the finest cambric, edged with right Mechlin: the knees of his\\r\\ncrimson velvet breeches scarce descended so low as to meet his silk\\r\\nstockings, which rose without spot or wrinkle on his meagre legs, from\\r\\nshoes of blue Meroquin, studded with diamond buckles that flamed forth\\r\\nrivals to the sun! A steel-hilted sword, inlaid with gold, and decked\\r\\nwith a knot of ribbon which fell down in a rich tassel, equipped his\\r\\nside; and an amber-headed cane hung dangling from his wrist. But the\\r\\nmost remarkable parts of his furniture were, a mask on his face, and\\r\\nwhite gloves on his hands, which did not seem to be put on with an\\r\\nintention to be pulled off occasionally, but were fixed with a curious\\r\\nring on the little finger of each hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this garb, Captain Whiffle, for that was his name, took possession\\r\\nof the ship, surrounded with a crowd of attendants, all of whom, in\\r\\ntheir different degrees, seemed to be of their patronâ\\x80\\x99s disposition;\\r\\nand the air was so impregnated with perfumes, that one may venture to\\r\\naffirm the climate of Arabia Felix was not half so sweet-scented. My\\r\\nfellow-mate, observing no surgeon among his train, thought he had found\\r\\nan occasion too favourable for himself to be neglected; and,\\r\\nremembering the old proverb, â\\x80\\x9cSpare to speak, and spare to speed,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nresolved to solicit the new captainâ\\x80\\x99s interest immediately, before any\\r\\nother surgeon could be appointed for the ship. With this view he\\r\\nrepaired to the cabin in his ordinary dress, consisting of a check\\r\\nshirt and trousers, a brown linen waistcoat, and a nightcap of the same\\r\\n(neither of them very clean,) which, for his further misfortune,\\r\\nhappened to smell strong of tobacco. Entering without any ceremony into\\r\\nthis sacred place, he found Captain Whiffle reposing upon a couch, with\\r\\na wrapper of fine chintz about his body, and a muslin cap bordered with\\r\\nlace about his head; and after several low congees began in this\\r\\nmanner: â\\x80\\x9cSir, I hope you will forgive, and excuse, and pardon, the\\r\\npresumption of one who has not the honour of being known to you, but\\r\\nwho is, nevertheless a shentleman porn and pred, and moreover has had\\r\\nmisfortunes, Cot help me, in the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere he was interrupted by the captain, who, on seeing him, had started\\r\\nup with great amazement, at the novelty of the apparition; and, having\\r\\nrecollected himself, pronounced with a look and tone signifying\\r\\ndisdain, curiosity and surprise, â\\x80\\x9cZauns! who art thou?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI am surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfirst mate on board of this ship,â\\x80\\x9d replied Morgan: â\\x80\\x9cand I most\\r\\nvehemently desire and beseech you, with all submission, to be pleased\\r\\nto condescend and vouchsafe to inquire into my character, and my\\r\\npehaviour, and my deserts, which, under Cot, I hope, will entitle me to\\r\\nthe vacancy of surgeon.â\\x80\\x9d As he proceeded in his speech, he continued\\r\\nadvancing towards the captain, whose nostrils were no sooner saluted\\r\\nwith the aromatic flavour that exhaled from him, than he cried with\\r\\ngreat emotion, â\\x80\\x9cHeaven preserve me! I am suffocated! Fellow, fellow,\\r\\naway with thee! Curse thee, fellow! Get thee gone! I shall be stunk to\\r\\ndeath!â\\x80\\x9d At the noise of his outcries, his servants ran into his\\r\\napartment, and he accosted them thus: â\\x80\\x9cVillains! cut-throats! traitors!\\r\\nI am betrayed! I am sacrificed! Will you not carry that monster away?\\r\\nor must I be stifled with the stench of him? oh, oh!â\\x80\\x9d With these\\r\\ninterjections he sank down upon his settee in a fit: his\\r\\nvalet-de-chambre plied him with a smelling-bottle, one footman chafed\\r\\nhis temples with Hungary water, another sprinkled the floor with\\r\\nspirits of lavender, a third pushed Morgan out of the cabin; who coming\\r\\nto the place where I was, sat down with a demure countenance and,\\r\\naccording to his custom, when he received any indignity which he durst\\r\\nnot revenge, began to sing a Welsh ditty.\\r\\n\\r\\nI guessed he was under some agitation of spirits and desired to know\\r\\nthe cause; but, instead of answering me directly, he asked with great\\r\\nemotion, if I thought him a monster and a stinkard? â\\x80\\x9cA monster and a\\r\\nstinkard!â\\x80\\x9d said I, with some surprise: â\\x80\\x9cdid anybody call you so?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cCot\\r\\nis my judge,â\\x80\\x9d replied be, â\\x80\\x9cCaptain Fifle did call me both; ay, and all\\r\\nthe waters in the Tawy will not wash it out of my remembrance. I do\\r\\naffirm and avouch, and maintain, with my soul, and my pody, and my\\r\\nplood, look you, that I have no smells apout me, but such as a\\r\\nChristian ought to have, except the effluvia of tobacco, which is a\\r\\ncephalic, odoriferous, aromatic herb; and he is a son of a mountain\\r\\ngoat who says otherwise. As for my being a minister, let that be as it\\r\\nis: I am as Cot was pleased to create me, which, peradventure, is more\\r\\nthan I shall ever aver of him who gave me that title; for I will\\r\\nproclaim it before the world, that he is disguised, and transfigured,\\r\\nand transmogrified, with affectation and whimseys; and that he is more\\r\\nlike a papoon than of the human race.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Whiffle sends for meâ\\x80\\x94his situation describedâ\\x80\\x94his surgeon\\r\\narrives, prescribes for him, and puts him to bedâ\\x80\\x94a bed is put up for\\r\\nMr. Simper contiguous to the state room, which, with other parts of the\\r\\ncaptains behaviour, gives the shipâ\\x80\\x99s company a very unfavourable idea\\r\\nof their commanderâ\\x80\\x94I am detained in the West Indies by the admiral, and\\r\\ngo on board of the Lizard sloop of war in quality of surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s mate,\\r\\nwhere I make myself known to the surgeon, who treats me very kindlyâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\ngo on shore, sell my ticket, purchase necessaries, and, at my return on\\r\\nboard, am surprised at the sight of Crampley, who is appointed\\r\\nlieutenant of the sloopâ\\x80\\x94we sail on a cruiseâ\\x80\\x94take a prize in which I\\r\\narrive at Port Morant under the command of my messmate, with whom I\\r\\nlive in great harmony\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was going on with an eulogium upon the captain, when I received a\\r\\nmessage to clean myself, and go up to the great cabin: and with this\\r\\ncommand I instantly complied, sweetening myself with rosewater from the\\r\\nmedicine chest. When I entered the room, I was ordered to stand by the\\r\\ndoor, until Captain Whiffle had reconnoitered me at a distance with a\\r\\nspy-glass. He, having consulted one sense in this manner, bade me\\r\\nadvance gradually, that his nose might have intelligence before it\\r\\ncould be much offended: I therefore approached with great caution and\\r\\nsuccess, and he was pleased to say, â\\x80\\x9cAy, this creature is tolerable.â\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\nfound him lolling on his couch with a languishing air, his head\\r\\nsupported by his valet-de-chambre, who from time to time applied a\\r\\nsmelling-bottle to his nose. â\\x80\\x9cVergette,â\\x80\\x9d said he in a squeaking tone,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdost think this wretch (meaning me) will do me no injury? May I\\r\\nventure to submit my arm to him?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPon my word,â\\x80\\x9d replied the valet, â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\ndo tink dat dere be great occasion for your honour losing a small\\r\\nquantite of blodt; and the young man ave quelque chose of de bonne\\r\\nmine.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell, then,â\\x80\\x9d said his master, â\\x80\\x9cI think I must venture.â\\x80\\x9d Then,\\r\\naddressing himself to me, â\\x80\\x9cHast thou ever blooded anybody but brutes?\\r\\nBut I need not ask thee, for thou wilt tell me a most dâ\\x80\\x94able lie,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBrutes, sir!â\\x80\\x9d answered I, pulling down his glove, in order to feel his\\r\\npulse, â\\x80\\x9cI never meddle with brutes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat the devil art thou about?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncried he, â\\x80\\x9cdost thou intend to twist off my hand? Gadâ\\x80\\x99s curse! my arm\\r\\nis benumbed up to the very shoulder! Heaven have mercy upon me! must I\\r\\nperish under the hands of savages? What an unfortunate dog was I to\\r\\ncome on board without my own surgeon, Mr. Simper.â\\x80\\x9d I craved pardon for\\r\\nhaving handled him so roughly, and, with the utmost care, and\\r\\ntenderness, tied up his arm with a fillet of silk. While I was feeling\\r\\nfor the vein, he desired to know how much blood I intended to take from\\r\\nhim, and, when I answered, â\\x80\\x9cnot above twelve ounces,â\\x80\\x9d started up with a\\r\\nlook full of horror, and bade me be gone, swearing I had a design upon\\r\\nhis life. Vergette appeased him with difficulty, and, opening a bureau,\\r\\ntook out a pair of scales, in one of which was placed a small cup; and\\r\\nputting them into my hand, told me, the captain never lost above an\\r\\nounce and three drams at one time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I prepared for this important evacuation, there came into the\\r\\ncabin a young man gaily dressed, of a very delicate complexion with a\\r\\nkind of languid smile on his face: which seemed to have been rendered\\r\\nhabitual by a long course of affectation. The captain no sooner\\r\\nperceived him, than, rising hastily, he flew into his arms, crying, â\\x80\\x9cO,\\r\\nmy dear Simper, I am excessively disordered! I have been betrayed,\\r\\nfrighted, murdered, by the negligence of my servants, who suffered a\\r\\nbeast, a mule, a bear, to surprise me, and stink me into convulsions\\r\\nwith the fumes of tobacco.â\\x80\\x9d Simper, who by this time, I found, was\\r\\nobliged to act for the clearness of his complexion, assumed an air of\\r\\nsoftness and sympathy, and lamented with many tender expressions of\\r\\nsorrow, the sad accident that had thrown him into that condition; then,\\r\\nfeeling his patientâ\\x80\\x99s pulse on the outside of his glove, gave it as his\\r\\nopinion, that his disorder was entirely nervous, and that some drops of\\r\\ntincture of castor, and liquid laudanum, would be of more service to\\r\\nhim than bleeding, by bridling the inordinate sallies of his spirits,\\r\\nand composing the fermentation of his bile. I was therefore sent to\\r\\nprepare this prescription, which was administered in a glass of sack\\r\\nposset, after the captain had been put to bed, and orders sent to the\\r\\nofficers on the quarter-deck, to let nobody walk on that side under\\r\\nwhich he lay.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the captain enjoyed his repose the doctor watched over him, and\\r\\nindeed became so necessary, that a cabin was made for him contiguous to\\r\\nthe state room where Whiffle slept, that he might be at hand in case of\\r\\naccidents in the night. Next day, our commander being happily\\r\\nrecovered, gave orders that none of the lieutenants should appear upon\\r\\ndeck without a wig, sword, and ruffles; nor any midshipman, or other\\r\\npetty officer, be seen with a check shirt or dirty linen. He also\\r\\nprohibited any person whatever, except Simper and his own servants,\\r\\nfrom coming into the great cabin without first sending in to obtain\\r\\nleave. These singular regulations did not prepossess the shipâ\\x80\\x99s company\\r\\nin his favour: but, on the contrary, gave scandal an opportunity to be\\r\\nvery busy with his character, and accuse him of maintaining a\\r\\ncorrespondence with his surgeon not fit to be named.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few weeks, our ship being under sailing orders, I was in hope of\\r\\nrevisiting my native country, in a very short time, when the admiralâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsurgeon came on board, and, sending for Morgan and me to the\\r\\nquarter-deck, gave us to understand there was a great scarcity of\\r\\nsurgeons in the West Indies; that he was commanded to detain one mate\\r\\nout of every great ship that was bound for England; and desired us to\\r\\nagree between ourselves, before the next day at that hour, which of us\\r\\nshould stay behind. We were thunderstruck at this proposal, and stared\\r\\nat one another some time without speaking; at length the Welshman broke\\r\\nsilence, and offered to remain in the West Indies, provided the admiral\\r\\nwould give him a surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s warrant immediately; but he was told there\\r\\nwas no want of chief surgeons, and that he must be contented with the\\r\\nstation of mate, till he should be further provided for in due course.\\r\\nWhereupon Morgan flatly refused to quit the ship for which the\\r\\ncommissioners of the navy had appointed him; and the other told him as\\r\\nplainly, that if we could not determine the affair by ourselves before\\r\\nto-morrow morning, he must cast lots, and abide by his chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I recalled to my remembrance the miseries I had undergone in\\r\\nEngland, where I had not one friend to promote my interest, or favour\\r\\nmy advancement in the navy, and the same time reflected on the present\\r\\ndearth of surgeons in the West Indies, and the unhealthiness of the\\r\\nclimate, which every day almost reduced the number, I could not help\\r\\nthinking my success would be much more certain and expeditious by my\\r\\nstaying where I was, than by returning to Europe. I therefore resolved\\r\\nto comply with a good grace, and next day, when we were ordered to\\r\\nthrow dice, told Morgan he needed not trouble himself, for I would\\r\\nvoluntarily submit to the admiralâ\\x80\\x99s pleasure. This frank declaration\\r\\nwas commended by the gentleman, who assured me, it should not fare the\\r\\nworse with me for my resignation. Indeed he was as good as his word,\\r\\nand that very afternoon procured a warrant, appointing me surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmate of the Lizard sloop-of-war, which put me on a footing with every\\r\\nfirst mate in the service.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy ticket being made out, I put my chest and bedding on board a canoe\\r\\nthat lay alongside, and, having shook hands with my trusty friend the\\r\\nsergeant, and honest Jack Rattlin, who was bound for Greenwich\\r\\nHospital, I took my leave of Morgan with many tears, after we had\\r\\nexchanged our sleeve buttons as remembrances of each other. Having\\r\\npresented my new warrant to the captain of the Lizard, I inquired for\\r\\nthe doctor, whom I no sooner saw than I recollected him to be one of\\r\\nthose young fellows with whom I had been committed to the round-house,\\r\\nduring our frolic with Jackson, as I have related before. He received\\r\\nme with a good deal of courtesy, and, when I put him in mind of our\\r\\nformer acquaintance, expressed great joy at seeing me again, and\\r\\nrecommended me to an exceeding good mess, composed of the gunner and\\r\\nmasterâ\\x80\\x99s mate. As there was not one sick person in the ship, I got\\r\\nleave to go ashore next day with the gunner, who recommended me to a\\r\\nJew, that bought my ticket at the rate of forty per cent discount; and,\\r\\nhaving furnished myself with the necessaries I wanted, returned on\\r\\nboard in the evening, and, to my surprise, found my old antagonist\\r\\nCrampley walking upon deck. Though I did not fear his enmity, I was\\r\\nshocked at his appearance, and communicated my sentiments on that\\r\\nsubject to Mr. Tomlins the surgeon, who told me that Crampley, by dint\\r\\nof some friends about the admiral, had procured a commission,\\r\\nconstituting him lieutenant on board the Lizard; and advised me, now he\\r\\nwas my superior officer, to behave with some respect towards him, or\\r\\nelse he would find a thousand opportunities of using me ill. This\\r\\nadvice was a bitter potion to me, whom pride and resentment had\\r\\nrendered utterly incapable of the least submission to, or even of a\\r\\nreconciliation with, the wretch who had, on many occasions, treated me\\r\\nso inhumanly: however, I resolved to have as little connection as\\r\\npossible with him, and to ingratiate myself as much as I could with the\\r\\nrest of the officers, whose friendship might be a bulwark to defend me\\r\\nfrom the attempts of his malice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn less than a week we sailed on a cruise, and having weathered the\\r\\neast end of the island, had the good fortune to take a Spanish\\r\\nbarcolongo, with her prize, which was an English ship bound for\\r\\nBristol, that sailed from Jamaica a fortnight before, without convoy.\\r\\nAll the prisoners who were well, we put onshore on the north side of\\r\\nthe island; the prizes were manned with Englishmen, and the command of\\r\\nthe barcolongo given to my friend the masterâ\\x80\\x99s mate, with orders to\\r\\ncarry them into Port Morant, and there to remain until the Lizardâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncruise should be ended, at which time she would touch at the same place\\r\\nin her way to Port Royal. With him I was sent to attend the wounded\\r\\nSpaniards as well as Englishmen, who amounted to sixteen, and to take\\r\\ncare of them on shore in a house that was to be hired as an hospital.\\r\\nThis destination gave me a great deal of pleasure, as I should, for\\r\\nsome time, be freed from the arrogance of Crampley, whose inveteracy\\r\\nagainst me had already broken out on two or three occasions since he\\r\\nwas become a lieutenant. My messmate, who very much resembled my uncle,\\r\\nboth in figure and disposition, treated me on board of the prize with\\r\\nthe utmost civility and confidence: and, among other favours, made me a\\r\\npresent of a silver-hilted hanger, and a pair of pistols mounted with\\r\\nthe same metal, which fell to his share in plundering the enemy. We\\r\\narrived safely at Morant, and, going on shore, pitched upon an empty\\r\\nstorehouse; which we hired for the reception of the wounded, who were\\r\\nbrought to it next day, with beds and other necessaries; and four of\\r\\nthe shipâ\\x80\\x99s company appointed to attend them and obey me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA strange adventureâ\\x80\\x94in consequence of which I am extremely\\r\\nhappyâ\\x80\\x94Crampley does me in offices with the Captain; but his malice is\\r\\ndefeated by the good-nature and friendship of the surgeonâ\\x80\\x94we return to\\r\\nPort Royalâ\\x80\\x94our Captain gets the command of a larger ship, and is\\r\\nsucceeded by an old manâ\\x80\\x94Brayl is provided forâ\\x80\\x94we receive orders to sail\\r\\nfor England\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen my patients were all in a fair way, my companion and commander,\\r\\nwhose name was Brayl, carried me up the country to the house of a rich\\r\\nplanter, with whom he was acquainted, where we were sumptuously\\r\\nentertained, and in the evening set out on our return to the ship. When\\r\\nwe had walked about a mile by moonlight, we perceived a horseman behind\\r\\nus, who coming up, wished us good even, and asked which way we went?\\r\\nHis voice, which was quite familiar to me, no sooner struck my ear,\\r\\nthan in spite of all my resolution and reflection, my hair bristled up,\\r\\nand I was seized with a violent fit of trembling, which Brayl\\r\\nmisinterpreting, bade me be under no concern. I told him he was\\r\\nmistaken in the cause of my disorder; and, addressing myself to the\\r\\nperson on horseback said, â\\x80\\x9cI could have sworn by your voice, that you\\r\\nwere a dear friend of mine, if I had not been certain of his death.â\\x80\\x9d To\\r\\nthis address, after some pause, he replied, â\\x80\\x9cThere are many voices as\\r\\nwell as faces that resemble one another; but, pray, what was your\\r\\nfriendâ\\x80\\x99s name.â\\x80\\x9d I satisfied him in that particular, and gave a short\\r\\ndetail of the melancholy fate of Thompson, not without many sighs and\\r\\nsome tears. A silence ensued, which lasted some minutes, and then the\\r\\nconversation turned on different subjects, till we arrived at a house\\r\\non the road, where the horseman alighted, and begged with so much\\r\\nearnestness that we would go in and drink a bowl of punch with him,\\r\\nthat we could not resist. But, if I was alarmed at his voice, what must\\r\\nmy amazement be, when I discovered by the light the very person of my\\r\\nlamented friend! Perceiving my confusion, which was extreme, he clasped\\r\\nme in his arms, and bedewed my face with tears. It was some time ere I\\r\\nrecovered the use of my reason, overpowered with this event, and longer\\r\\nstill before I could speak. So that all I was capable of was to return\\r\\nhis embraces, and to mingle the overflowings of my joy with his; whilst\\r\\nhonest Brayl, affected with the scene, wept as fast as either of us,\\r\\nand signified his participation of our happiness by hugging us both,\\r\\nand capering about the room like a madman. At length, I retrieved the\\r\\nuse of my tongue, and cried, â\\x80\\x9cIs it possible! you can be my friend\\r\\nThompson? No certainly, alas! he was drowned; and I am now under the\\r\\ndeception of a dream!â\\x80\\x9d He was at great pains to convince me of his\\r\\nbeing the individual person whom I regretted, and bidding me sit down\\r\\nand compose myself, promised to explain his sudden disappearance from\\r\\nthe Thunder, and to account for his being at present in the land of the\\r\\nliving. This task he acquitted himself of, after I had drunk a glass of\\r\\npunch, and recollected my spirits, by informing us, that with a\\r\\ndetermination to rid himself of a miserable existence, he had gone in\\r\\nthe night-time to the head, while the ship was on her way, from whence\\r\\nhe slipped down as softly as he could, by the bows into the sea, where,\\r\\nafter he was heartily ducked, he began to repent of his precipitation;\\r\\nand, as he could swim very well, kept himself above water, in hopes of\\r\\nbeing taken up by some of the ships astern; that, in this situation, he\\r\\nhailed a large vessel, and begged to be taken in, but was answered that\\r\\nshe was a heavy sailer, and therefore they did not choose to lose time\\r\\nby bringing to; however, they threw an old chest overboard for his\\r\\nconvenience, and told him, that some of the ships astern would\\r\\ncertainly save him; that no other vessel came within sight or cry of\\r\\nhim for the space of three hours, during which time he had the\\r\\nmortification to find himself in the middle of the ocean alone, without\\r\\nother support or resting-place, but what a few crazy boards afforded;\\r\\ntill at last he discerned a small sloop steering towards him, upon\\r\\nwhich he set up his throat, and had the good fortune to be heard and\\r\\nrescued from the dreary waste by their boat, which was hoisted out on\\r\\npurpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was no sooner brought on board,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, â\\x80\\x9cthan I fainted, and,\\r\\nwhen I recovered my senses, found myself in bed, regaled with a most\\r\\nnoisome smell of onions and cheese, which made me think at first that I\\r\\nwas in my own hammock, alongside of honest Morgan, and that all which\\r\\nhad passed was no more than a dream. Upon inquiry, I understood that I\\r\\nwas on board of a schooner belonging to Rhode Island, bound for\\r\\nJamaica, with a cargo of geese, pigs, onions, and cheese, and that the\\r\\nmasterâ\\x80\\x99s name was Robertson, by birth a North Briton, whom I knew at\\r\\nfirst sight to be an old school-fellow of mine. When I discovered\\r\\nmyself to him, he was transported with surprise and joy, and begged to\\r\\nknow the occasion of my misfortune, which I did not think fit to\\r\\ndisclose, because I knew his notions with regard to religion were very\\r\\nsevere and confined; therefore contented myself with telling him I fell\\r\\noverboard by accident; but made no scruple of explaining the nature of\\r\\nmy disagreeable station, and of acquainting him with my determined\\r\\npurpose never to return to the Thunder man-of-war. Although he was not\\r\\nof my opinion in that particular, knowing that I must lose my clothes\\r\\nand what pay was due to me, unless I went back to my duty; yet, when I\\r\\ndescribed the circumstances of the hellish life I led under the\\r\\ntyrannic sway of Oakum and Mackshane; and, among other grievances,\\r\\nhinted a dissatisfaction at the irreligious deportment of my shipmates,\\r\\nand the want of the true presbyterian gospel doctrine; he changed his\\r\\nsentiments, and conjured me with great vehemence and zeal to lay aside\\r\\nall thought of rising in the navy; and, that he might show how much he\\r\\nhad my interest at heart, undertook to provide for me in some shape or\\r\\nother, before he should leave Jamaica. This promise he performed to my\\r\\nheartâ\\x80\\x99s desire, by recommending me to a gentleman of fortune, with whom\\r\\nI have lived ever since in quality of surgeon and overseer to his\\r\\nplantations. He and his lady are now at Kingston, so that I am, for the\\r\\npresent, master of this house, to which, from my soul, I bid you\\r\\nwelcome, and hope you will favour me with your company during the\\r\\nremaining part of the night.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI needed not a second invitation; but Mr. Brayl, who was a diligent and\\r\\nexcellent officer, could not be persuaded to sleep out of the ship;\\r\\nhowever, he supped with us, and, after having drank a cheerful glass,\\r\\nset out for the vessel, which was not above three miles from the place,\\r\\nescorted by a couple of stout negroes, whom Mr. Thompson ordered to\\r\\nconduct him. Never were two friends more happy in the conversation of\\r\\neach other than we, for the time it lasted. I related to him the\\r\\nparticulars of our attempt upon Carthagena, of which he had heard but\\r\\nan imperfect account; and he gratified me with a narration of every\\r\\nlittle incident of his life since we parted. He assured me, it was with\\r\\nthe utmost difficulty he could resist his inclination of coming down to\\r\\nPort Royal, to see Morgan and me, of whom he had heard no tidings since\\r\\nthe day of our separation: but that he was restrained by the fear of\\r\\nbeing detained as a deserter. He told me that, when he heard my voice\\r\\nin the dark, he was almost as much surprised as I was at seeing him\\r\\nafterwards: and, in the confidence of friendship, disclosed a passion\\r\\nhe entertained for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he\\r\\nlived, who, by his description, was a very amiable young lady, and did\\r\\nnot disdain his addresses; that he was very much favoured by her\\r\\nparents; and did not despair of obtaining their consent to the match,\\r\\nwhich would at once render him independent of the world. I\\r\\ncongratulated him on his good fortune, which he protested should never\\r\\nmake him forget his friends; and, towards morning, we betook ourselves\\r\\nto rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day he accompanied me to the ship, where Mr. Brayl entertained him\\r\\nat dinner, and we having spent the afternoon together, he took his\\r\\nleave of us in the evening, after he had forced upon me ten pistoles,\\r\\nas a small token of his affection. In short, while he stayed here, we\\r\\nsaw one another every day, and generally ate at the same table, which\\r\\nwas plentifully supplied by him with all kinds of poultry, butcherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmeat, oranges, limes, lemons, pine-apples, Madeira wine, and excellent\\r\\nrum; so that this small interval of ten days was by far the most\\r\\nagreeable period of my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the Lizard arrived; and my patients being all fit for duty,\\r\\nthey and I were ordered on board of her, where I understood from Mr.\\r\\nTomlins that there was a shyness between the lieutenant and him on my\\r\\naccount; the rancorous villain having taken the opportunity of my\\r\\nabsence to fill the captainâ\\x80\\x99s ears with a thousand scandalous stories\\r\\nto my prejudice; among other things affirming, that I had been once\\r\\ntransported for theft, and that when I was in the Thunder man-of-war, I\\r\\nhad been whipped for the same crime. The surgeon, on the other hand,\\r\\nhaving heard my whole story from my own mouth, defended me strenuously,\\r\\nand in the course of that good-natured office recounted all the\\r\\ninstances of Crampleyâ\\x80\\x99s malice against me while I remained on board of\\r\\nthat ship; which declaration, while it satisfied the captain of my\\r\\ninnocence, made the lieutenant as much my defenderâ\\x80\\x99s enemy as mine. The\\r\\ninfernal behaviour of Crampley, with regard to me, added such fuel to\\r\\nhis former resentment, that, at certain times, I was quite beside\\r\\nmyself with the desire of revenge, and was even tempted to pistol him\\r\\non the quarter-deck, though an infamous death must inevitably have been\\r\\nmy reward. But the surgeon, who was my confidant, argued against such a\\r\\ndesperate action so effectually, that I stifled the flame which\\r\\nconsumed me for the present, and resolved to wait for a more convenient\\r\\nopportunity. In the meantime, that Mr. Tomlins might be the more\\r\\nconvinced of the wrongs I suffered by this fellowâ\\x80\\x99s slander, I begged\\r\\nhe would go and visit Mr. Thompson, whose wonderful escape I had made\\r\\nhim acquainted with, and inquire of him into the particulars of my\\r\\nconduct, while he was my fellow-mate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis request the surgeon complied with, more through curiosity to see a\\r\\nperson whose fate had been so extraordinary, than to confirm his good\\r\\nopinion of me, which he assured me was already firmly established. He\\r\\ntherefore set out for the dwelling-place of my friend, with a letter of\\r\\nintroduction from me; and being received with all the civility and\\r\\nkindness I expected, returned to the ship, not only satisfied with my\\r\\ncharacter beyond the power of doubt or insinuation, but also charmed\\r\\nwith the affability and conversation of Thompson, who loaded him and me\\r\\nwith presents of fresh stock, liquors, and fruit. As he would not\\r\\nventure to come and see us on board, lest Cramplay should know and\\r\\ndetain him; when the time of our departure approached, I obtained leave\\r\\nto go and bid him farewell. After we had vowed an everlasting\\r\\nfriendship, he pressed upon me a purse, with four doubloons, which I\\r\\nrefused as long as I could without giving umbrage; and, having\\r\\ncordially embraced each other, I returned on board, where I found a\\r\\nsmall box, with a letter directed for me, to the care of Mr. Tomlins.\\r\\nKnowing the superscription to be of Thompsonâ\\x80\\x99s handwriting, I opened it\\r\\nwith some surprise, and learned that this generous friend, not content\\r\\nwith loading me with the presents already mentioned, had sent, for my\\r\\nuse and acceptance, half a dozen fine shirts, and as many linen\\r\\nwaistcoats and caps, with twelve pair of new thread stockings. Being\\r\\nthus provided with money and all necessaries for the comfort of life, I\\r\\nbegan to look upon myself as a gentleman of some consequence, and felt\\r\\nmy pride dilate a pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day we sailed for Port Royal, where we arrived safely with our\\r\\nprizes; and, as there was nothing to do on board, I went ashore, and\\r\\nhaving purchased a laced waistcoat, with some other clothes, at a sale,\\r\\nmade a swaggering figure for some days among the taverns, where I\\r\\nventured to play a little at hazard, and came off with fifty pistoles\\r\\nin my pocket. Meanwhile our captain was promoted to a ship of twenty\\r\\nguns, and the command of the Lizard given to a man turned of fourscore,\\r\\nwho had been lieutenant since the reign of King William, and,\\r\\nnotwithstanding his long service, would have probably died in that\\r\\nstation, had he not applied some prize-money he had lately received, to\\r\\nmake interest with his superiors. My friend Brayl was also made an\\r\\nofficer about the same time, after he had served in quality of a\\r\\nmidshipman and mate for five and twenty years. Soon after these\\r\\nalterations, the admiral pitched upon our ship to carry home dispatches\\r\\nfor the ministry; and we set sail for England, having first scrubbed\\r\\nher bottom, and taken in provision and water for the occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe depart for Europeâ\\x80\\x94a misunderstanding arises between the Captain and\\r\\nthe Surgeon, through the scandalous aspersions of Crampleyâ\\x80\\x94the Captain\\r\\ndiesâ\\x80\\x94Crampley tyrannises over the surgeon, who falls a Victim for his\\r\\nCrueltyâ\\x80\\x94I am also ill-usedâ\\x80\\x94the Ship strikesâ\\x80\\x94the behaviour of Crampley\\r\\nand the Seamen on that occasionâ\\x80\\x94-I get on shore, challenge the Captain\\r\\nto single combatâ\\x80\\x94am treacherously knocked down, wounded, and robbed\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that I could return to my native country in a creditable way, I\\r\\nfelt excessive pleasure in finding myself out of sight of that fatal\\r\\nisland, which has been the grave of so many Europeans: and, as I was\\r\\naccommodated with everything to make the passage agreeable, I resolved\\r\\nto enjoy myself as much as the insolence of Crampley would permit. This\\r\\ninsidious slanderer had found means already to cause a misunderstanding\\r\\nbetween the surgeon and captain, who, by his age and infirmities, was\\r\\nrendered intolerably peevish, his disposition having also been soured\\r\\nby a long course of disappointments. He had a particular aversion to\\r\\nall young men, especially to surgeons, whom he considered unnecessary\\r\\nanimals on board of a ship; and, in consequence of these sentiments,\\r\\nnever consulted the doctor, notwithstanding his being seized with a\\r\\nviolent fit of the gout and gravel, but applied to a cask of Holland\\r\\ngin, which was his sovereign prescription against all distempers:\\r\\nwhether he was at this time too sparing, or took an overdose of his\\r\\ncordial, certain it is, he departed in the night, without any ceremony,\\r\\nwhich indeed was a thing he always despised, and was found stiff next\\r\\nmorning, to the no small satisfaction of Crampley, who succeeded to the\\r\\ncommand of the vessel. For that very reason, Mr. Tomlins and I had no\\r\\ncause to rejoice at this event, fearing that the tyranny of our new\\r\\ncommander would now be as unlimited as his power. The first day of his\\r\\ncommand justified our apprehensions: for, on pretence that the decks\\r\\nwere too much crowded, he ordered the surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s hencoops, with all his\\r\\nfowls, to be thrown overboard; and at the same time prohibited him and\\r\\nme from walking on the quarter-deck.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Tomlins could not help complaining of these injuries, and in the\\r\\ncourse of his expostulation dropped some hasty words, of which Crampley\\r\\ntaking hold, confined him to his cabin, where, in a few days, for want\\r\\nof air he was attacked by a fever, which soon put an end to his life,\\r\\nafter he had made his will, by which he bequeathed all his estate,\\r\\npersonal and real, to his sister, and left to me his watch and\\r\\ninstruments as memorials of his friendship. I was penetrated with grief\\r\\non this melancholy occasion; the more because there was nobody on board\\r\\nto whom I could communicate my sorrows, or of whom I could receive the\\r\\nleast consolation or advice. Crampley was so far from discovering the\\r\\nleast remorse for his barbarity, at the news of the surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s death,\\r\\nthat he insulted his memory in the most abusive manner, and affirmed he\\r\\nhad poisoned himself out of pure fear, dreading to be brought to a\\r\\ncourt-martial for mutiny; for which reason he would not suffer the\\r\\nservice of the dead to be read over his body before it was thrown\\r\\noverboard.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing but a speedy deliverance could have supported me under the\\r\\nbrutal sway of this bashaw, who, to render my life more irksome,\\r\\nsignified to my messmates a desire that I should be expelled from their\\r\\nsociety. This was no sooner hinted, than they granted his request; and\\r\\nI was fain to eat in a solitary manner by myself during the rest of the\\r\\npassage, which, however, soon drew to a period.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had been seven weeks at sea, when the gunner told the captain that,\\r\\nby his reckoning, we must be in soundings, and desired he would order\\r\\nthe lead to be heaved. Crampley swore he did not know how to keep the\\r\\nshipâ\\x80\\x99s way, for we were not within a hundred leagues of soundings, and\\r\\ntherefore he would not give himself the trouble to cast the lead.\\r\\nAccordingly we continued our course all that afternoon and night,\\r\\nwithout shortening sail, although the gunner pretended to discover\\r\\nScilly light; and next morning protested in form against the captainâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nconduct, for which he was put in confinement, We discovered no land all\\r\\nthat day, and Crampley was still so infatuated as to neglect sounding;\\r\\nbut at three oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning the ship struck, and remained fast\\r\\non a sand-bank. This accident alarmed the whole crew; the boat was\\r\\nimmediately hoisted out, but as we could not discern which way the\\r\\nshore lay, we were obliged to wait for daylight. In the meantime, the\\r\\nwind increased, and the waves beat against the sloop with such\\r\\nviolence, that we expected she would have gone to pieces. The gunner\\r\\nwas released and consulted: he advised the captain to cut away the\\r\\nmast, in order to lighten her; this expedient was performed without\\r\\nsuccess: the sailors, seeing things in a desperate situation, according\\r\\nto custom, broke up the chests belonging to the officers, dressed\\r\\nthemselves in their clothes, drank their liquors without ceremony, and\\r\\ndrunkenness, tumult, and confusion ensued.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the midst of this uproar, I went below to secure my own effects, and\\r\\nfound the carpenterâ\\x80\\x99s mate hewing down the purserâ\\x80\\x99s cabin with his\\r\\nhatchet, whistling all the while with great composure. When I asked his\\r\\nintention in so doing, he replied, very calmly, â\\x80\\x9cI only want to taste\\r\\nthe purserâ\\x80\\x99s rum, thatâ\\x80\\x99s all, master.â\\x80\\x9d At that instant the purser\\r\\ncoming down, and seeing his effects going to wreck, complained bitterly\\r\\nof the injustice done to him, and asked the fellow what occasion he had\\r\\nfor liquor when, in all likelihood, he would be in eternity in a few\\r\\nminutes. â\\x80\\x9cAllâ\\x80\\x99s one for that,â\\x80\\x9d said plunderer, â\\x80\\x9clet us live while we\\r\\ncan.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cMiserable wretch that thou art!â\\x80\\x9d cried the purser, â\\x80\\x9cwhat must be\\r\\nthy lot in another world, if thou diest in the commission of robbery?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy, hell, I suppose,â\\x80\\x9d replied the other, with great deliberation,\\r\\nwhile the purser fell on his knees, and begged of Heaven that we might\\r\\nnot all perish for the sake of Jonas.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this dialogue I clothed myself in my bed apparel, girded on my\\r\\nhanger, stuck my pistols, loaded, in my belt, disposed of all my\\r\\nvaluable moveables about my person, and came upon deck with a\\r\\nresolution of taking the first opportunity to get on shore, which, when\\r\\nthe day broke, appeared at the distance of three miles ahead. Crampley,\\r\\nfinding his efforts to get the ship off ineffectual, determined to\\r\\nconsult his own safety, by going into the boat, which he had no sooner\\r\\ndone, than the shipâ\\x80\\x99s company followed so fast, that she would have\\r\\nsunk alongside, had not some one wiser than the rest cut the rope and\\r\\nput off. But before this happened, I had made several attempts to get\\r\\nin, and was always balked by the captain, who was so eager in excluding\\r\\nme, that he did not mind the endeavours of any other body. Enraged at\\r\\nthis inhuman partiality, and seeing the rope cut, I pulled one of my\\r\\npistols from my belt, and cocking it, swore I would shoot any man who\\r\\nwould presume to obstruct my entrance. So saying, I leaped with my full\\r\\nexertion, and got on board of the boat with the loss of the skin of my\\r\\nshins. I chanced in my descent to overturn Crampley, who no sooner got\\r\\nup than he struck at me several times with a cutlass, and ordered the\\r\\nmen to throw me overboard; but they were too anxious about their own\\r\\nsafety to mind what he said. Though the boat was very deeply loaded,\\r\\nand the sea terribly high, we made shift to get upon dry land in less\\r\\nthan an hour after we parted from the sloop. As soon as I set my foot\\r\\non terra firma, my indignation, which had boiled so long within me,\\r\\nbroke out against Crampley, whom I immediately challenged to single\\r\\ncombat, presenting my pistols, that he might take his choice: he took\\r\\none without hesitation, and, before I could cock the other, fired in my\\r\\nface, throwing the pistol after the shot. I felt myself stunned, and\\r\\nimagining the bullet had entered my brain, discharged mine as quick as\\r\\npossible, that I might not die unrevenged: then flying upon my\\r\\nantagonist, knocked out several of his fore-teeth with the butt-end of\\r\\nthe piece, and would certainly have made an end of him with that\\r\\ninstrument, had he not disengaged himself, and seized his cutlass,\\r\\nwhich he had given to his servant when he received the pistol. Seeing\\r\\nhim armed in this manner, I drew my hanger, and, having flung my pistol\\r\\nat his head, closed with him in a transport of fury, and thrust my\\r\\nweapon into his mouth, which it enlarged on one side to his ear.\\r\\nWhether the smart of this wound disconcerted him, or the unevenness of\\r\\nthe ground made him reel, I know not, but he staggered some paces back:\\r\\nI followed close, and with one stroke cut the tendons of the back of\\r\\nhis hand, Upon which his cutlass dropped, and he remained defenceless.\\r\\nI know not with what cruelty my rage might have inspired me, if I had\\r\\nnot at that instant been felled to the ground by a blow on the back\\r\\npart of my head, which deprived me of all sensation. In this deplorable\\r\\nsituation, exposed to the rage of an incensed barbarian, and the rapine\\r\\nof an inhuman crew, I remained for some time; and whether any disputes\\r\\narose among them during the state of my annihilation, I cannot pretend\\r\\nto determine; but in one particular they seemed to have been unanimous,\\r\\nand acted with equal dexterity and dispatch; for when I recovered the\\r\\nuse of my understanding, I found myself alone in a desolate place,\\r\\nstripped of my clothes, money, watch, buckles, and everything but my\\r\\nshoes, stockings, breeches and shirt. What a discovery must this have\\r\\nbeen to me, who, but an hour before, was worth sixty guineas in cash! I\\r\\ncursed the hour of my birth, the parents that gave me being, the sea\\r\\nthat did not swallow me up, the poniard of the enemy, which could not\\r\\nfind the way to my heart, the villainy of those who had left me in that\\r\\nmiserable condition; and in the ecstacy of despair resolved to be still\\r\\nwhere I was, and perish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI get up and crawl into a barn, where I am in danger of perishing,\\r\\nthrough the fear of the country peopleâ\\x80\\x94their inhumanityâ\\x80\\x94I am succoured\\r\\nby a reputed witchâ\\x80\\x94her storyâ\\x80\\x94her adviceâ\\x80\\x94she recommends me as a valet to\\r\\na single lady, whose character she explains\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as I lay ruminating, my passion insensibly abated; I considered my\\r\\nsituation in quite another light, from that in which it appeared to me\\r\\nat first, and the result of my deliberation was to rise if I could, and\\r\\ncrawl to the next inhabited place for assistance. With some difficulty\\r\\nI got upon my legs, and having examined my body, found I had received\\r\\nno other injury than two large contused wounds, one on the fore and\\r\\nanother on the hinder part of my head, which seemed to be occasioned by\\r\\nthe same weapon, namely, the butt-end of a pistol. I looked towards the\\r\\nsea, but could discern no remains of the ship; so that I concluded she\\r\\nwas gone to pieces, and that those who remained in her had perished:\\r\\nbut, as I afterwards learned, the gunner, who had more sagacity than\\r\\nCrampley, observing that it was flood when he left her, and that she\\r\\nwould probably float at high water, made no noise about getting on\\r\\nshore, but continued on deck, in hopes of bringing her safe into some\\r\\nharbour, after her commander should have deserted her, for which piece\\r\\nof service he expected, no doubt, to be handsomely rewarded. This\\r\\nscheme he accordingly executed, and was promised great things by the\\r\\nAdmiralty for saving his Majestyâ\\x80\\x99s ship: but I never heard he reaped\\r\\nthe fruits of his expectation. As for my own part, I directed my course\\r\\ntowards a small cottage I perceived, and in the road picked up a\\r\\nseamanâ\\x80\\x99s old jacket, which I suppose the thief who dressed himself in\\r\\nmy clothes had thrown away: this was a very comfortable acquisition to\\r\\nme, who was almost stiff with cold: I therefore put it on; and, as my\\r\\nnatural heat revived, my wounds, which had left off bleeding, burst out\\r\\nafresh; so that, finding myself excessively exhausted, I was about to\\r\\nlie down in the fields, when I discovered a barn on my left hand,\\r\\nwithin a few yards of me; thither I made shift to stagger, and finding\\r\\nthe door open, went in, but saw nobody; however, I threw myself upon a\\r\\ntruss of straw, hoping to be soon relieved by some person or other. I\\r\\nhad not lain here many minutes, when I saw a countryman come in with a\\r\\npitchfork in his hand, which he was upon the point of thrusting into\\r\\nthe straw that concealed me, and in all probability would have done my\\r\\nbusiness, had I not uttered a dreadful groan, after having essayed in\\r\\nvain to speak. This melancholy note alarmed the clown, who started\\r\\nback, and discovering a body all besmeared with blood, stood trembling,\\r\\nwith the pitchfork extended before him, his hair bristling up, his eyes\\r\\nstaring, his nostrils dilated, and his mouth wide open. At another time\\r\\nI should have been much diverted by this figure, which preserved the\\r\\nsame attitude very near ten minutes, during which time I made many\\r\\nunsuccessful efforts to implore his compassion and assistance; but my\\r\\ntongue failed me, and my language was only a repetition of groans. At\\r\\nlength an old man arrived, who, seeing the other in such a posture,\\r\\ncried, â\\x80\\x9cMercy upon en! the leaadâ\\x80\\x99s bewitched! why, Dick, beest thou\\r\\nbesayd thyself!â\\x80\\x9d Dick, without moving his eyes from the object that\\r\\nterrified him, replied, â\\x80\\x9cO vather! vather! here be either the devil or\\r\\na dead mon: I doant know which oâ\\x80\\x99en, but a groans woundily.â\\x80\\x9d The\\r\\nfather, whose eyesight was none of the best, pulled out his spectacles,\\r\\nand, having applied them to his nose reconnoitered me over his sonâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nshoulder: but no sooner did he behold me, than he was seized with a fit\\r\\nof shaking, even more violent than Dickâ\\x80\\x99s, and, with a broken accent,\\r\\naddressed me thus: â\\x80\\x9cIn the name of the Vather, Zun, and Holy Ghost, I\\r\\ncharge you, an you been Satan, to be gone to the Red Zen; but an you be\\r\\na moordered mon, speak, that you may have a Christom burial.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was not in a condition to satisfy him in this particular, he\\r\\nrepeated his conjuration to no purpose, and they continued a good while\\r\\nin the agonies of fear. At length the father proposed that the son\\r\\nshould draw nearer, and take a more distinct view of the apparition;\\r\\nbut Dick was of opinion that his father should advance first, he being\\r\\nan old man past his labour and, if he received any mischief, the loss\\r\\nwould be the smaller; whereas he himself might escape, and be useful,\\r\\nin his generation. This prudential reason had no effect upon the\\r\\nsenior, who still kept Dick between me and him. In the meantime I\\r\\nendeavoured to raise one hand as a signal of distress, but had only\\r\\nstrength sufficient to produce a rustling among the straw, which\\r\\ndiscomposed the young peasant so much, that he sprang out at the door,\\r\\nand overthrew his father in his flight. The old gentleman would not\\r\\nspend time in getting up, but crawled backwards like a crab, with great\\r\\nspeed, till he had got over the threshold, mumbling exorcisms all the\\r\\nway. I was exceedingly mortified to find myself in danger of perishing\\r\\nthrough the ignorance and cowardice of these clowns; and felt my\\r\\nspirits decay apace, when an old woman entered the barn, followed by\\r\\nthe two fugitives and with great intrepidity advanced to the place\\r\\nwhere I lay, saying, â\\x80\\x9cIf it be the devil I fearen not, and for a dead\\r\\nmon a can do us no harm.â\\x80\\x9d When she saw my condition, she cried, â\\x80\\x9cHere\\r\\nbe no devil, but in your en foolâ\\x80\\x99s head. Here be a poor miserable\\r\\nwretch bleeding to death, and if a dies, we must be at the charge of\\r\\nburying him; therefore, Dick, go vetch the old wheelbarrow and put en\\r\\nin, and carry en to goodman Hodgeâ\\x80\\x99s backdoor; he is more able than we\\r\\nto pay out money upon poor vagrants.â\\x80\\x9d Her advice was taken, and\\r\\nimmediately put in execution; I was rolled to the other farmerâ\\x80\\x99s door,\\r\\nwhere I was tumbled out like a heap of dung; and should certainly have\\r\\nfallen a prey to the hogs, if my groans had not disturbed the family,\\r\\nand brought some of them out to view my situation. But Hodge resembled\\r\\nthe Jew more than the good Samaritan, and ordered me to be carried to\\r\\nthe house of the parson, whose business it was to practise as well as\\r\\nto preach charity; observing that it was sufficient for him to pay his\\r\\nquota towards the maintenance of the poor belonging to his own parish.\\r\\nWhen I was set down at the vicarâ\\x80\\x99s gate, he fell into a mighty passion,\\r\\nand threatened to excommunicate him who sent, as well as those who\\r\\nbrought me, unless they would move me immediately to another place.\\r\\nAbout this time I fainted with the fatigue I had undergone, and\\r\\nafterwards understood that I was bandied from door to door through a\\r\\nwhole village, nobody having humanity enough to administer the least\\r\\nrelief to me, Until an old woman, who was suspected of witchcraft by\\r\\nthe neighbourhood, hearing of my distress, received me into her house,\\r\\nand, having dressed my wounds, brought me to myself with cordials of\\r\\nher own preparing. I was treated with great care and tenderness by this\\r\\ngrave matron, who, after I had recovered some strength, desired to know\\r\\nthe particulars of my last disaster. This piece of satisfaction I could\\r\\nnot refuse to one who had saved my life, therefore related all my\\r\\nadventures without exaggeration or reserve. She seemed surprised at the\\r\\nvicissitudes I had undergone, and drew a happy presage of my future\\r\\nlife from my past suffering, then launched out into the praise of\\r\\nadversity, with so much ardour and good sense, that I concluded she was\\r\\na person who had seen better days, and conceived a longing desire to\\r\\nhear her story. She perceived my drift by some words I dropped, and\\r\\nsmiling told me, there was nothing either entertaining or extraordinary\\r\\nin the course of her fortune; but, however, she would communicate it to\\r\\nme, in consideration of the confidence I had reposed in her. â\\x80\\x9cIt is of\\r\\nlittle consequence,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cto tell the names of my parents, who\\r\\nare dead many years ago; let it suffice to assure you, they were\\r\\nwealthy, and had no other child than me; so that I was looked upon as\\r\\nheiress to a considerable estate, and teased with addresses on that\\r\\naccount. Among the number of my admirers, there was a young gentleman\\r\\nof no fortune, whose sole dependence was on his promotion in the army,\\r\\nin which, at that time, he bore a lieutenantâ\\x80\\x99s commission. I conceived\\r\\nan affection for this amiable officer, which, in a short time,\\r\\nincreased to a violent passion, and without entering into minute\\r\\ncircumstances, married him privately. We had not enjoyed one another\\r\\nlong in stolen interviews, when he was ordered with his regiment to\\r\\nFlanders; but, before he set out, it was agreed between us, that we\\r\\nshould declare our marriage to my father by letter, and implore his\\r\\npardon for the step we had taken without his approbation. This\\r\\ndiscovery was made while I was abroad visiting, and just as I was about\\r\\nto return home, I received a letter from my father, importing that,\\r\\nsince I had acted so undutifully and meanly as to marry a beggar,\\r\\nwithout his privity or consent, to the disgrace of his family as well\\r\\nas the disappointment of his hopes, he renounced me to the miserable\\r\\nfate I had entailed upon myself, and charged me never to set foot\\r\\nwithin his doors again. This rigid sentence was confirmed by my mother,\\r\\nwho, in a postscript, gave me to understand that her sentiments were\\r\\nexactly conformable to those of my father, and that I might save myself\\r\\nthe trouble of making any applications, for her resolutions were\\r\\nunalterable. Thunderstruck with my evil fortune I called a coach, and\\r\\ndrove to my husbandâ\\x80\\x99s lodgings, where I found him waiting the event of\\r\\nhis letter. Though he could easily divine by my looks the issue of his\\r\\ndeclaration, he read with great steadiness the epistle I had received;\\r\\nand with a smile full of tenderness, which I shall never forget,\\r\\nembraced me, saying, â\\x80\\x9cI believe the good lady your mother might have\\r\\nspared herself the trouble of the last part of her postscript. Well, my\\r\\ndear Betty, you must lay aside all thoughts of a coach, till I can\\r\\nprocure the command of a regiment.â\\x80\\x9d This unconcerned behaviour, while\\r\\nit enabled me to support my reverse of fortune, at the same time\\r\\nendeared him to me the more, by convincing me of his disinterested\\r\\nviews in espousing me. I was next day boarded in company with the wife\\r\\nof another officer, who had long been the friend and confidant of my\\r\\nhusband, at a village not far from London, where they parted with us in\\r\\nthe most melting manner, went to Flanders, and were killed in sight of\\r\\none another at the battle of the Wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy should I tire you with a description of our unutterable sorrow at\\r\\nthe fatal news of this event, the remembrance of which now fills my\\r\\naged eyes with tears! When our grief subsided a little, and reflection\\r\\ncame to our aid, we found ourselves deserted by the whole world, and in\\r\\ndanger of perishing by want; whereupon we made application for the\\r\\npension, and were put upon the list. Then, vowing eternal friendship,\\r\\nsold our jewels and superfluous clothes, retired to this place (which\\r\\nis in the county of Sussex) bought this little house, where we lived\\r\\nmany years in a solitary manner, indulging our mutual sorrow, till it\\r\\npleased Heaven to call away my companion two years ago; since which\\r\\ntime I have lingered out an unhappy being, in hopes of a speedy\\r\\ndissolution, when I promise myself the eternal reward of all my cares.\\r\\nIn the meantime,â\\x80\\x9d continued she, â\\x80\\x9cI must inform you of the character I\\r\\nbear among my neighbours. My conversation being different from that of\\r\\nthe inhabitants of the village, my recluse way of life, my skill in\\r\\ncuring distempers, which I acquired from books since I settled here,\\r\\nand lastly, my age having made the common people look upon me as\\r\\nsomething preternatural, and I am actually, at this hour, believed to\\r\\nbe a witch. The parson of the parish, whose acquaintance I have not\\r\\nbeen at much pains to cultivate, taking umbrage at my supposed\\r\\ndisrespect, has contributed not a little towards the confirmation of\\r\\nthis opinion, by dropping certain hints to my prejudice among the\\r\\nvulgar, who are also very much scandalised at my entertaining this poor\\r\\ntabby cat with the collar about her neck, which was a favourite of my\\r\\ndeceased companion.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole behaviour of this venerable person was so primitive,\\r\\ninnocent, sensible, and humane, that I contracted a filial respect for\\r\\nher, and begged her advice with regard to my future conduct, as soon as\\r\\nI was in a condition to act for myself. She dissuaded me from a design\\r\\nI had formed of travelling to Louder, in hopes of retrieving my clothes\\r\\nand pay, by returning to my ship, which by this time I read in the\\r\\nnewspaper was safely arrived in the River Thames: â\\x80\\x9cbecause,â\\x80\\x9d said she,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou run the hazard of being treated not only as a deserter in quitting\\r\\nthe sloop, but also as a mutineer, in assaulting your commanding\\r\\nofficer, to the malice of whose revenge you will moreover be exposed.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nShe then promised to recommend me, as servant to a single lady of her\\r\\nacquaintance, who lived in the neighbourhood with her nephew, who was a\\r\\nyoung foxhunter of great fortune, where I might be very happy, provided\\r\\nI could bear with the disposition and manners of my mistress, which\\r\\nwere somewhat whimsical and particular. But, above all things, she\\r\\ncounselled me to conceal my story, the knowledge of which would\\r\\neffectually poison my entertainment; for it was a maxim, among most\\r\\npeople of condition, that no gentleman ought to be admitted into a\\r\\nfamily as a domestic, lest he become lazy, and insolent. I was fain to\\r\\nembrace this humble proposal, because my affairs were desperate; and in\\r\\na few days was hired by this lady, to serve in quality of her footman,\\r\\nhaving been represented by my hostess as a young man who was bred up to\\r\\nthe sea by his relations against his will, and had suffered shipwreck,\\r\\nwhich had increased his disgust to that way of life so much, that he\\r\\nrather chose to go to service on shore, than enter himself on board of\\r\\nany other ship. Before I took possession of my new place, she gave me a\\r\\nsketch of my mistressâ\\x80\\x99s character, that I might know better how to\\r\\nregulate my conduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour lady,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cis a maiden of forty years, not so remarkable\\r\\nfor her beauty as her learning and taste, which is famous all over the\\r\\ncountry. Indeed, she is a perfect female virtuoso, and so eager after\\r\\nthe pursuit of knowledge that she neglects her person even to a degree\\r\\nof sluttishness; this negligence, together with her contempt of the\\r\\nmale part of the creation, gives her nephew no great concern, as by\\r\\nthese means he will probably keep her fortune, which is considerable in\\r\\nthe family. He therefore permits her to live in her own way, which is\\r\\nsomething extraordinary, and gratifies her in all her whimsical\\r\\ndesires. Her apartment is at some distance from the other inhabited\\r\\nparts of the house; and consists of a dining-room, bedchamber, and\\r\\nstudy; she keeps a cook maid, a waiting-woman, and footman, of her own,\\r\\nand seldom eats or converses with any of the family but her niece, who\\r\\nis a very lovely creature, and humours her aunt often to the prejudice\\r\\nof her own health by sitting up with her whole nights together; for\\r\\nyour mistress is too much of a philosopher to be swayed by the custom\\r\\nof the world, and never sleeps nor eats like other people. Among other\\r\\nodd notions, she professes the principles of Rosicrucius, and believes\\r\\nthe earth, air, and sea, are inhabited by invisible beings, with whom\\r\\nit is possible for the human species to entertain correspondence and\\r\\nintimacy, on the easy condition of living chaste. As she hopes one day\\r\\nto be admitted into an acquaintance of this kind, she no sooner heard\\r\\nof me and my cat, than she paid me a visit, with a view, as she has\\r\\nsince owned, to be introduced to my familiar; and was greatly mortified\\r\\nto find herself disappointed in her expectation. Being by this\\r\\nvisionary turn of mind abstracted as it were from the world, she cannot\\r\\nadvert to the common occurrences of life; and therefore is frequently\\r\\nso absent as to commit very strange mistakes and extravagancies, which\\r\\nyou will do well to rectify and repair, as your prudence shall\\r\\nsuggest.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXXIX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Reception by that Ladyâ\\x80\\x94I become enamoured of Narcissaâ\\x80\\x94recount the\\r\\nparticulars of my last misfortuneâ\\x80\\x94acquire the good opinion of my\\r\\nMistressâ\\x80\\x94an Account of the young Squireâ\\x80\\x94I am made acquainted with more\\r\\nparticulars of Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s Situationâ\\x80\\x94conceive a mortal hatred against\\r\\nSir Timothyâ\\x80\\x94examine my Ladyâ\\x80\\x99s library and performancesâ\\x80\\x94her extravagant\\r\\nbehaviour\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFraught with these useful instructions, I repaired to the place of her\\r\\nhabitation, and was introduced by the waiting-woman to the presence of\\r\\nmy lady, who had not before seen me. She sat in her study, with one\\r\\nfoot on the ground, and the other upon a high stool at some distance\\r\\nfrom her seat; her sandy locks hung down, in a disorder I cannot call\\r\\nbeautiful, from her head, which was deprived of its coif, for the\\r\\nbenefit of scratching with one hand, while she held the stump of a pen\\r\\nin the other. Her forehead was high and wrinkled; her eyes were large,\\r\\ngray, and prominent; her nose was long, and aquiline: her mouth of vast\\r\\ncapacity, her visage meagre and freckled, and her chin peaked like a\\r\\nshoemakerâ\\x80\\x99s paring knife; her upper lip contained a large quantity of\\r\\nplain Spanish, which, by continual falling, had embroidered her neck,\\r\\nthat was not naturally very white, and the breast of her gown, that\\r\\nflowed loose about her with a negligence that was truly poetic,\\r\\ndiscovering linen that was very fine, and, to all appearance, never\\r\\nwashed but in Castalian streams. Around her lay heaps of books, globes,\\r\\nquadrants, telescopes, and other learned apparatus; her snuff-box stood\\r\\nat her right hand: at her left hand lay her handkerchief, sufficiently\\r\\nused, and a convenience to spit in appeared on one side of her chair.\\r\\nShe being in a reverie when we entered, the maid did not think proper\\r\\nto disturb her; so that we waited some minutes unobserved, during which\\r\\ntime she bit the quill several times, altered her position, made many\\r\\nwry faces, and, at length, with an air of triumph, repeated aloud:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNor dare thâ\\x80\\x99immortal gods my rage oppose!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving committed her success to paper, she turned towards the door, and\\r\\nperceiving us, cried, â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80\\x99s the young man,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nreplied my conductress, â\\x80\\x9cwhom Mrs. Sagely recommended as a footman to\\r\\nyour ladyship.â\\x80\\x9d On this information she stared in my face for a\\r\\nconsiderable time, and then asked my name, which I thought proper to\\r\\nconceal under that of John Brown. After having surveyed me with a\\r\\ncurious eye, she broke out into, â\\x80\\x9cO! ay, thou wast shipwrecked, I\\r\\nremember. Whether didst thou come on shore on the back of a whale or a\\r\\ndolphin?â\\x80\\x9d To this I answered, I had swam ashore without any assistance.\\r\\nThen she demanded to know if I had ever been at the Hellespont, and\\r\\nswam from Sestos to Abydos. I replied in the negative; upon which she\\r\\nbade the maid order a suit of new livery for me, and instruct me in the\\r\\narticles of my duty: so she spit in her snuff-box, and wiped her nose\\r\\nwith her cap, which lay on the table, instead of a handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned to the kitchen, where I was regaled by the maids, who\\r\\nseemed to vie with each other in expressing their regard for me; and\\r\\nfrom them I understood, that my business consisted in cleaning knives\\r\\nand forks, laying the cloth, waiting at table, carrying messages, and\\r\\nattending my lady when she went abroad. There was a very good suit of\\r\\nlivery in the house, which had belonged to my predecessor deceased, and\\r\\nit fitted me exactly; so that there was no occasion for employing a\\r\\ntailor on my account. I had not been long equipped in this manner, when\\r\\nmy ladyâ\\x80\\x99s bell rung; upon which, I ran up stairs, and found her\\r\\nstalking about the room in her shift and under petticoat only; I would\\r\\nimmediately have retired as became me, but she bade me come in, and air\\r\\na clean shift for her; which operation I having performed with some\\r\\nbackwardness, she put it on before me without any ceremony, and I\\r\\nverily believe was ignorant of my sex all that time, as being quite\\r\\nabsorbed in contemplation. About four oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the afternoon I was\\r\\nordered to lay the cloth, and place two covers, which I understood were\\r\\nfor my mistress and her niece, whom I had not as yet seen. Though I was\\r\\nnot very dexterous at this work, I performed it pretty well for a\\r\\nbeginner, and, when dinner was upon the table, saw my mistress\\r\\napproach, accompanied by the young lady, whose name for the present\\r\\nshall be Narcissa. So much sweetness appeared in the countenance and\\r\\ncarriage of this amiable apparition, that my heart was captivated at\\r\\nfirst sight, and while dinner lasted, I gazed upon her without\\r\\nintermission. Her age seemed to be seventeen, her stature tall, her\\r\\nshape unexceptionable, her hair, that fell down upon her ivory neck in\\r\\nringlets, black as jet; her arched eyebrows of the same colour; her\\r\\neyes piercing, yet tender; her lips of the consistence and hue of\\r\\ncherries; her complexion clear, delicate and healthy; her aspect noble,\\r\\ningenuous, and humane; and the whole person so ravishingly delightful,\\r\\nthat it was impossible for any creature endued with sensibility, to see\\r\\nwithout admiring, and admire without loving her to excess. I began to\\r\\ncurse the servile station that placed me so far beneath the regard of\\r\\nthis idol of my adoration! and yet I blessed my fate, that enabled me\\r\\nto enjoy daily the sight of so much perfection! When she spoke I\\r\\nlistened with pleasure; but when she spoke to me, my soul was thrilled\\r\\nwith an extacy of tumultuous joy. I was even so happy as to be the\\r\\nsubject of their conversation; for Narcissa, having observed me, said\\r\\nto her aunt, â\\x80\\x9cI see your new footman is come.â\\x80\\x9d Then addressing herself\\r\\nto me, asked, with ineffable complacency, if I was the person who had\\r\\nbeen so cruelly used by robbers? When I had satisfied her in this; she\\r\\nexpressed a desire of knowing the other particulars of my fortune, both\\r\\nbefore and since my being shipwrecked: hereupon (as Mrs. Sagely had\\r\\ncounselled me) I told her that I had been bound apprentice to the\\r\\nmaster of a ship, contrary to my inclination, which ship had foundered\\r\\nat sea; that I and four more, who chanced to be on deck when she went\\r\\ndown, made shift to swim to the shore, when my companions, after having\\r\\noverpowered me, stripped me to the shirt, and left me, as they\\r\\nimagined, dead of the wounds I received in my own defence. Then I\\r\\nrelated the circumstances of being found in a barn, with the inhuman\\r\\ntreatment I met with from the country people and parson; the\\r\\ndescription of which, I perceived, drew tears from the charming\\r\\ncreatureâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. When I had finished my recital, my mistress, said, â\\x80\\x9cMa\\r\\nfoi! le garÃ§on est bien fait!â\\x80\\x9d To which opinion Narcissa assented, with\\r\\na compliment to my understanding, in the same language, that flattered\\r\\nmy vanity extremely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation, among other subjects, turned upon the young squire,\\r\\nwhom my lady inquired after under the title of the Savage; and was\\r\\ninformed by her niece that he was still in bed, repairing the fatigue\\r\\nof last nightâ\\x80\\x99s debauch, and recruiting strength and spirits to undergo\\r\\na fox chase to-morrow morning, in company with Sir Timothy Thicket,\\r\\nSquire Bumper, and a great many other gentlemen of the same stamp, whom\\r\\nhe had invited on that occasion! so that by daybreak the whole house\\r\\nwould be in an uproar. This was a very disagreeable piece of news to\\r\\nthe virtuoso, who protested she would stuff her ears with cotton when\\r\\nshe went to bed, and take a dose of opium to make her sleep the more\\r\\nsound, that she might not be disturbed and distracted by the clamour of\\r\\nthe brutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen their dinner was over, I and my fellow servants sat down to ours\\r\\nin the kitchen, where I understood that Sir Timothy Thicket was a\\r\\nwealthy knight in the neighbourhood, between whom and Narcissa a match\\r\\nhad been projected by her brother, who promised at the same time to\\r\\nespouse Sir Timothyâ\\x80\\x99s sister; by which means, as their fortunes were\\r\\npretty equal, the young ladies would be provided for, and their\\r\\nbrothers be never the poorer; but that the ladies did not concur in the\\r\\nscheme, each of them entertaining a hearty contempt for the person\\r\\nallotted to her for a husband by this agreement. This information begat\\r\\nin me a mortal aversion to Sir Timothy, whom I looked upon as my rival,\\r\\nand cursed in my heart for his presumption.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, by daybreak, being awakened by the noise of the hunters\\r\\nand hounds, I rose to view the cavalcade, and had a sight of my\\r\\ncompetitor, whose accomplishments (the estate excluded) did not seem\\r\\nbrilliant enough to give me much uneasiness with respect to Narcissa,\\r\\nwho, I flattered myself, was not to be won by such qualifications as he\\r\\nwas master of, either as to person or mind. My mistress,\\r\\nnotwithstanding her precaution, was so much disturbed by her nephewâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncompany, that she did not rise till five oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the afternoon; so\\r\\nthat I had an opportunity of examining her study at leisure, to which\\r\\nexamination I was strongly prompted by my curiosity. Here I found a\\r\\nthousand scraps of her own poetry, consisting of three, four, ten,\\r\\ntwelve, and twenty lines, on an infinity of subjects, which, as whim\\r\\ninspired, she had begun, without constancy or capacity to bring to any\\r\\ndegree of composition: but, what was very extraordinary in a female\\r\\npoet, there was not the least mention made of love in any of her\\r\\nperformances. I counted fragments of five tragedies, the titles of\\r\\nwhich were â\\x80\\x9cThe Stern Philosopher,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe Double,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe Sacrilegious\\r\\nTraitor,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThe Fall of Lucifer,â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cThe Last Day.â\\x80\\x9d From whence I\\r\\ngathered, that her disposition was gloomy, and her imagination\\r\\ndelighted with objects of horror. Her library was composed of the best\\r\\nEnglish historians, poets, and philosophers; of all the French critics\\r\\nand poets, and of a few books in Italian, chiefly poetry, at the head\\r\\nof which were Tasso and Ariosto, pretty much used. Besides these,\\r\\ntranslations of the classics into French, but not one book in Greek or\\r\\nLatin; a circumstance that discovered her ignorance in these languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having taken a full view of this collection, I retired, and at\\r\\nthe usual time was preparing to lay the cloth, when I was told by the\\r\\nmaid that her mistress was still in bed, and had been so affected with\\r\\nthe notes of the hounds in the morning, that she actually believed\\r\\nherself a hare beset by the hunters, and begged a few greens to munch\\r\\nfor breakfast. When I expressed my surprise in this unaccountable\\r\\nimagination she gave me to understand that her lady was very much\\r\\nsubject to whims of this nature; sometimes fancying herself an animal,\\r\\nsometimes a piece of furniture, during which conceited transformations\\r\\nit was very dangerous to come near her, especially when she represented\\r\\na beast; for that lately, in the character of a cat, she had flown at\\r\\nher, and scratched her face in a terrible manner: that some months ago,\\r\\nshe prophesied the general conflagration was at hand, and nothing would\\r\\nbe able to quench it but her water, which therefore she kept so long,\\r\\nthat her life was in danger, and she must needs have died of the\\r\\nretention, had they not found an expedient to make her evacuate, by\\r\\nkindling a bonfire under her chamber window and persuading her that the\\r\\nhouse was in flames: upon which, with great deliberation, she bade them\\r\\nbring all the tubs and vessels they could find to be filled for the\\r\\npreservation of the house, into one of which she immediately discharged\\r\\nthe cause of her distemper. I was also informed that nothing\\r\\ncontributed so much to the recovery of her reason as music, which was\\r\\nalways administered on those occasions by Narcissa, who played\\r\\nperfectly well on the harpsichord, and to whom she (the maid) was just\\r\\nthen going to intimate her auntâ\\x80\\x99s disorder.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was no sooner gone than I was summoned by the bell to my ladyâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nchamber, where I found her sitting squat on her hands on the floor, in\\r\\nthe manner of puss when she listens to the outcries of her pursuers.\\r\\nWhen I appeared, she started up with an alarmed look, and sprang to the\\r\\nother side of the room to avoid me, whom, without doubt, she mistook\\r\\nfor a beagle thirsting after her life. Perceiving her extreme\\r\\nconfusion, I retired, and on the staircase met the adorable Narcissa\\r\\ncoming up, to whom I imparted the situation of my mistress; she said\\r\\nnot a word, but smiling with unspeakable grace, went into her auntâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\napartment, and in a little time my ears were ravished with the efforts\\r\\nof her skill. She accompanied the instrument with a voice so sweet and\\r\\nmelodious, that I did not wonder at the surprising change it produced\\r\\non the spirits of my mistress which composed to peace and sober\\r\\nreflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout seven oâ\\x80\\x99clock, the hunters arrived with the skins of two foxes\\r\\nand one badger, carried before them as trophies of their success; and\\r\\nwhen they were about to sit down to dinner (or supper) Sir Timothy\\r\\nThicket desired that Narcissa would honour the table with her presence;\\r\\nbut this request, notwithstanding her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s threats and entreaties,\\r\\nshe refused, on pretence of attending her aunt, who was indisposed; so\\r\\nI enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing my rival mortified: but this\\r\\ndisappointment made no great impression on him, who consoled himself\\r\\nwith the bottle, of which the whole company became so enamoured that,\\r\\nafter a most horrid uproar of laughing, singing, swearing, and\\r\\nfighting, they were all carried to bed in a state of utter oblivion. My\\r\\nduty being altogether detached from the squire and his family, I led a\\r\\npretty easy and comfortable life, drinking daily intoxicating draughts\\r\\nof love from the charms of Narcissa, which brightened on my\\r\\ncontemplation every day more and more. Inglorious as my station was, I\\r\\nbecame blind to my own unworthiness, and even conceived hopes of one\\r\\nday enjoying this amiable creature, whose, affability greatly\\r\\nencouraged these presumptuous thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mistress is surprised at my learningâ\\x80\\x94communicates her performances\\r\\nto meâ\\x80\\x94I impart some of mine to herâ\\x80\\x94am mortified at her faint\\r\\npraiseâ\\x80\\x94Narcissa approves of my conductâ\\x80\\x94I gain an involuntary conquest\\r\\nover the cookwench and dairymaidâ\\x80\\x94their mutual resentment and\\r\\ninsinuationsâ\\x80\\x94the jealousy of their lovers\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this season of love and tranquillity, my muse, which had lain\\r\\ndormant so long, awoke, and produced several small performances on the\\r\\nsubject of my flame. But as it concerned me nearly to remain\\r\\nundiscovered in my character and sentiments, I was under a necessity of\\r\\nmortifying my desire of praise, by confining my works to my own perusal\\r\\nand applause. In the meantime I strove to insinuate myself into the\\r\\ngood opinion of both ladies; and succeeded so well, by my diligence and\\r\\ndutiful behaviour, that in a little time I was at least a favourite\\r\\nservant; and frequently enjoyed the satisfaction of hearing myself\\r\\nmentioned in French and Italian, with some degree of warmth and\\r\\nsurprise by the dear object of all my wishes, as a person who had so\\r\\nmuch of the gentleman in my appearance and discourse, that she could\\r\\nnot for her soul treat me like a common lacquey. My prudence and\\r\\nmodesty were not long proof against these bewitching compliments. One\\r\\nday, while I waited at dinner, the conversation turned upon a knotty\\r\\npassage of Tassoâ\\x80\\x99s Gierusalem, which, it seems, had puzzled them both:\\r\\nafter a great many unsatisfactory conjectures, my mistress, taking the\\r\\nbook out of her pocket, turned up the place in question, and read the\\r\\nsentence over and over without success; at length, despairing of\\r\\nfinding the authorâ\\x80\\x99s meaning, she turned to me, saying, â\\x80\\x9cCome hither,\\r\\nBruno; let us see what fortune will do for us: I will interpret to thee\\r\\nwhat goes before, and what follows this obscure paragraph, the\\r\\nparticular words of which I will also explain, that thou mayst, by\\r\\ncomparing one with another, guess the sense of that which perplexes\\r\\nus.â\\x80\\x9d I was too vain to let slip this opportunity of displaying my\\r\\ntalents; therefore, without hesitation, read and explained the whole of\\r\\nthat which had disconcerted them, to the utter astonishment of both.\\r\\nNarcissaâ\\x80\\x99s face and lovely neck were overspread with blushes, from\\r\\nwhich I drew a favourable opinion, while her aunt, after having stared\\r\\nat me a good while with a look of amazement, exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cIn the name of\\r\\nheaven who art thou?â\\x80\\x9d I told her I had picked up a smattering of\\r\\nItalian, during a voyage up the Straits. At this explanation she shook\\r\\nher head, and observed that no smatterer could read as I had done. She\\r\\nthen desired to know if I understood French. To which question I\\r\\nanswered in the affirmative. She asked if I was acquainted with the\\r\\nLatin and Greek? I replied, â\\x80\\x9cA little.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOho!â\\x80\\x9d continued she, â\\x80\\x9cand with\\r\\nphilosophy and mathematics, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d I owned I knew something of\\r\\neach. Then she repeated her stare and interrogation. I began to repent\\r\\nof my vanity, and in order to repair the fault I committed, said, it\\r\\nwas not to be wondered at if I had a tolerable education, for learning\\r\\nwas so cheap in my country, that every peasant was a scholar; but, I\\r\\nhoped her Ladyship would think my understanding no exception to my\\r\\ncharacter. â\\x80\\x9cNo, no, God forbid.â\\x80\\x9d But during the rest of the time they\\r\\nsat at table, they behaved with remarkable reserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis alteration gave me great uneasiness; and I passed the night\\r\\nwithout sleep, in melancholy reflections on the vanity of young men,\\r\\nwhich prompts them to commit so many foolish actions, contrary to their\\r\\nown sober judgment. Next day, however, instead of profiting by this\\r\\nself-condemnation, I yielded still more to the dictates of the\\r\\nprinciple I had endeavoured to chastise, and if fortune had not\\r\\nbefriended me more than prudence could expect, I should have been\\r\\ntreated with the contempt it deserved. After breakfast my lady, who was\\r\\na true author, bade me follow her into the study, where she expressed\\r\\nherself thus: â\\x80\\x9cSince you are so learned, you cannot be void of taste;\\r\\ntherefore I am to desire your opinion of a small performance in poetry,\\r\\nwhich I lately composed. You must know that I have planned a tragedy,\\r\\nthe subject of which shall be, the murder of a prince before the altar,\\r\\nwhere he is busy at his devotions. After the deed is perpetrated, the\\r\\nregicide will harangue the people with the bloody dagger in his hand;\\r\\nand I have already composed a speech, which, I think, will suit the\\r\\ncharacter extremely. Here it is.â\\x80\\x9d Then, taking up a scrap of paper, she\\r\\nread, with violent emphasis and gesture, as follows:â\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThus have I sent the simple King to hell,\\r\\nWithout or coffin, shroud, or passing bell:\\r\\nTo me what are divine and human laws?\\r\\nI court no sanction but my own applause!\\r\\nRapes, robberies, treasons, yield my soul delight,\\r\\nAnd human carnage gratifies my sight:\\r\\nI drag the parent by the hoary hair,\\r\\nAnd toss the sprawling infant on the spear,\\r\\nWhile the fond motherâ\\x80\\x99s cries regale my ear.\\r\\nI fight, I vanquish, murder friends and foes;\\r\\nNor dare the immortal gods my rage oppose.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough I did great violence to my understanding in praising this\\r\\nunnatural rhapsody, I nevertheless extolled it as a production that of\\r\\nitself deserved immortal fame; and besought her ladyship to bless the\\r\\nworld with the fruits of those uncommon talents Heaven had bestowed\\r\\nupon her. She smiled with a look of self-complacency, and encouraged by\\r\\nthe incense I had offered, communicated all her poetical works which I\\r\\napplauded, one by one, with as little candour as I had shown at first.\\r\\nSatiated with my flattery, which I hope my situation justified, she\\r\\ncould not in conscience refuse me an opportunity of shining in my turn:\\r\\nand, therefore, after a compliment to my nice discernment and taste,\\r\\nobserved, that doubtless I must have produced something in that way\\r\\nmyself, which she desired to see. This was temptation I could by no\\r\\nmeans resist. I owned that while I was at college I wrote some detached\\r\\npieces, at the desire of a friend who was in love; and at her request\\r\\nrepeated the following verses, which indeed my love for Narcissa had\\r\\ninspired:â\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Celia,\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaying on the harpsichord and singing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Sappho struck the quivering wire,\\r\\nThe throbbing breast was all on fire:\\r\\nAnd when she raised the vocal lay,\\r\\nThe captive soul was charmâ\\x80\\x99d away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut had the nymph possessed with these\\r\\nThy softer, chaster, power to please;\\r\\nThy beauteous air of sprightly youth,\\r\\nThy native smiles of artless truth;\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worm of grief had never preyed\\r\\nOn the forsaken love-sick maid:\\r\\nNor had she mournâ\\x80\\x99d a hapless flame,\\r\\nNor dashâ\\x80\\x99d on rocks her tender frame.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mistress paid me a cold compliment on the versification, which, she\\r\\nsaid, was elegant enough, but, the subject beneath the pen of a true\\r\\npoet. I was extremely nettled at her indifference, and looked at\\r\\nNarcissa, who by this time had joined us, for her approbation; but she\\r\\ndeclined giving her opinion, protesting she was no judge of these\\r\\nmatters; so that I was forced to retire very much balked in my\\r\\nexpectation, which was generally a little too sanguine. In the\\r\\nafternoon, however, the waiting-maid assured me that Narcissa had\\r\\nexpressed her approbation of my performance with great warmth, and\\r\\ndesired her to procure a copy of it as for herself, that she (Narcissa)\\r\\nmight have an opportunity to peruse it at pleasure. I was elated to an\\r\\nextravagant pitch at this intelligence, and immediately transcribed a\\r\\nfair copy of my Ode, which was carried to the dear charmer, together\\r\\nwith another on the same subject, as follows:â\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\nThy fatal shaft unerring move;\\r\\nI bow before thine altar, Love!\\r\\nI feel thou soft resistless flame\\r\\nGlide swift through all my vital frame!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor while I gaze my bosom glows,\\r\\nMy blood in tides impetuous flows;\\r\\nHope, fear, and joy alternate roll,\\r\\nAnd floods of transports â\\x80\\x99whelm my soul!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy faltering tongue attempts in vain\\r\\nIn soothing murmurs to complain;\\r\\nMy tongue some secret magic ties,\\r\\nMy murmurs sink in broken sighs.\\r\\n\\r\\nCondemnâ\\x80\\x99d to nurse eternal care,\\r\\nAnd ever drop the silent tear,\\r\\nUnheard I mourn, unknown I sigh,\\r\\nUnfriended live, unpitied die!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether or not Narcissa discovered my passion, I could not learn from\\r\\nher behaviour, which, though always benevolent to me was henceforth\\r\\nmore reserved and less cheerful. While my thoughts aspired to a sphere\\r\\nso far above me, I had unwittingly made a conquest of the cookwench and\\r\\ndairymaid, who became so jealous of each other that, if their\\r\\nsentiments had been refined by education, it is probable one or other\\r\\nof them would have had recourse to poison or steel to be avenged of her\\r\\nrival; but, as their minds were happily adapted to their humble\\r\\nstation, their mutual enmity was confined to scolding and fistcuffs, in\\r\\nwhich exercise they were both well skilled. My good fortune did not\\r\\nlong remain a secret; for it was disclosed by the frequent broils of\\r\\nthese heroines, who kept no decorum in their encounters. The coachman\\r\\nand gardener, who paid their devoirs to my admirers, each to his\\r\\nrespective choice, alarmed at my success, laid their heads together, in\\r\\norder to concert a plan of revenge; and the former, having been\\r\\neducated at the academy at Tottenham Court, undertook to challenge me\\r\\nto single combat. He accordingly, with many opprobrious invectives,\\r\\nbade me defiance, and offered to box me for twenty guineas. I told him\\r\\nthat, although I believed myself a match for him even at that work I\\r\\nwould not descend so far below the dignity of a gentleman as to fight\\r\\nlike a porter; but if he had anything to say to me, I was his man at\\r\\nblunderbuss, musket, pistol, sword, hatchet, spit, cleaver, fork, or\\r\\nneedle; nay, I swore, that should he give his tongue any more saucy\\r\\nliberties at my expense, I would crop his ears without any ceremony.\\r\\nThis rhodomontade, delivered with a stern countenance and resolute\\r\\ntone, had the desired effect upon my antagonist, who, with some\\r\\nconfusion, sneaked off, and gave his friend an account of his\\r\\nreception.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story, taking air among the servants, procured for me the title of\\r\\nGentleman John, with which I was sometimes honoured, even by my\\r\\nmistress and Narcissa, who had been informed of the whole affair by the\\r\\nchambermaid. In the meantime, the rival queens expressed their passion\\r\\nby all the ways in their power: the cook entertained me with choice\\r\\nbits, the dairymaid with strokings: the first would often encourage me\\r\\nto declare myself, by complimenting me upon my courage and learning,\\r\\nand observing, that if she had a husband like me, to maintain order and\\r\\nkeep accounts, she could make a great deal of money, by setting up an\\r\\neating-house in London for gentlemenâ\\x80\\x99s servants on board wages. The\\r\\nother courted my affection by showing her own importance, and telling\\r\\nme that many a substantial farmer in the neighbourhood would be glad to\\r\\nmarry her, but she was resolved to please her eye, if she should plague\\r\\nher heart. Then she would launch out into the praise of my proper\\r\\nperson, and say, she was sure I would make a good husband, for I was\\r\\nvery good-natured. I began to be uneasy at the importunities of these\\r\\ninamoratas, whom, at another time perhaps, I might have pleased without\\r\\nthe disagreeable sauce of matrimony, but, at present, my whole soul was\\r\\nengrossed by Narcissa; and I could not bear the thoughts of doing\\r\\nanything derogatory to the passion I entertained for her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNarcissa being in danger from the brutality of Sir Timothy, is rescued\\r\\nby me, who revenge myself on my rivalâ\\x80\\x94I declare my passion, and retreat\\r\\nto the seasideâ\\x80\\x94am surrounded by smugglers, and carried to Boulogneâ\\x80\\x94find\\r\\nmy Uncle Lieutenant Bowling in great distress, and relieve himâ\\x80\\x94our\\r\\nconversation\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt certain intervals my ambition would revive; I would despise myself\\r\\nfor my tame resignation to my sordid fate, and revolve a hundred\\r\\nschemes for assuming the character of a gentleman, to which I thought\\r\\nmyself entitled by birth and education. In these fruitless suggestions\\r\\ntime stole away unperceived, and I had already remained eight months in\\r\\nthe station of a footman, when an accident happened that put an end to\\r\\nmy servitude, and, for the present, banished all hopes of succeeding in\\r\\nmy love.\\r\\n\\r\\nNarcissa went one day to visit Miss Thicket, who lived with her brother\\r\\nwithin less than a mile of our house, and was persuaded to walk home in\\r\\nthe cool of the evening, accompanied by Sir Timothy, who, having a good\\r\\ndeal of the brute in him, was instigated to use some unbecoming\\r\\nfamiliarities with her, encouraged by the solitariness of a field\\r\\nthrough which they passed. The lovely creature was incensed at his rude\\r\\nbehaviour for which she reproached him in such a manner that he lost\\r\\nall regard to decency, and actually offered violence to this pattern of\\r\\ninnocence and beauty. But Heaven would not suffer so much goodness to\\r\\nbe violated, and sent me, who, passing by accident near the place, was\\r\\nalarmed with her cries, for her succour. What were the emotions of my\\r\\nsoul, when I beheld Narcissa almost sinking beneath the brutal force of\\r\\nthis satyr! I flew like lightning to her rescue, and he, perceiving me,\\r\\nquitted his prey, and drew his hanger to chastise my presumption. My\\r\\nindignation was too high to admit one thought of fear, so that, rushing\\r\\nupon him, I struck his weapon out of his hand, and used my cudgel so\\r\\nsuccessfully that he fell to the ground, and lay, to all appearance,\\r\\nwithout sense. Then I turned to Narcissa, who had swooned, and sitting\\r\\ndown by her, gently raised her head, and supported it on my bosom,\\r\\nwhile, with my hand around her waist, I kept her in that position. My\\r\\nsoul was thrilled with tumultuous joy, at feeling the object of my\\r\\ndearest wishes within my arms; and, while she lay insensible, I could\\r\\nnot refrain from applying my cheeks to hers, and ravishing a kiss. In a\\r\\nlittle time the blood began to revisit her face, she opened her\\r\\nenchanting eyes, and, having recollected her late situation, said, with\\r\\na look full of tender acknowledgment, â\\x80\\x9cDear John, I am eternally\\r\\nobliged to you!â\\x80\\x9d So saying she made an effort to rise, in which I\\r\\nassisted her, and she proceeded to the house, leaning upon me all the\\r\\nway. I was a thousand times tempted by this opportunity to declare my\\r\\npassion, but the dread of disobliging her restrained my tongue. We had\\r\\nnot moved a hundred paces from the scene of her distress, when I\\r\\nperceived Sir Timothy rise and walk homewardâ\\x80\\x94a circumstance which,\\r\\nthough it gave me some satisfaction, inasmuch as I thereby knew I had\\r\\nnot killed him, filled me with just apprehension of his resentment,\\r\\nwhich I found myself in no condition to withstand; especially when I\\r\\nconsidered his intimacy with our squire, to whom I knew he could\\r\\njustify himself for what he had done, by imputing it to his love, and\\r\\ndesiring his brother Bruin to take the same liberty with his sister,\\r\\nwithout any fear of offence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we arrived at the house, Narcissa assured me she would exert all\\r\\nher influence in protecting me from the revenge of Thicket, and\\r\\nlikewise engage her aunt in my favour. At the same time, pulling out\\r\\nher purse, offered it as a small consideration for the service I had\\r\\ndone her. But I stood too much upon the punctilios of love to incur the\\r\\nleast suspicion of being mercenary, and refused the present, by saying\\r\\nI had merited nothing by barely doing my duty. She seemed astonished at\\r\\nmy disinterestedness, and blushed: I felt the same suffusion, and, with\\r\\na downcast eye and broken accent, told her I had one request to make,\\r\\nwhich, if her generosity would grant, I should think myself fully\\r\\nrecompensed, for an age of misery. She changed colour at this preamble,\\r\\nand, with great confusion, replied, she hoped my good sense would\\r\\nhinder me from asking anything she was bound in honour to refuse, and\\r\\ntherefore bade me signify my desire. Upon which I kneeled, and engaged\\r\\nto kiss her hand. She immediately, with an averted look, stretched it\\r\\nout: I imprinted on it an ardent kiss, and, bathing it with my tears,\\r\\ncried, â\\x80\\x9cDear Madam, I am an unfortunate gentleman, and love you to\\r\\ndistraction, but would have died a thousand deaths rather than make\\r\\nthis declaration under such a servile appearance, were I not determined\\r\\nto yield to the rigour of my fate, to fly from your bewitching\\r\\npresence, and bury my presumptuous passion in eternal silence.â\\x80\\x9d With\\r\\nthese words I rose, and went away before she could recover her spirits\\r\\nso far as to make any reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first care was to go and consult Mrs. Sagely, with whom I had\\r\\nentertained a friendly correspondence ever since I left her house. When\\r\\nshe understood my situation, the good woman, with real concern,\\r\\ncondoled with me on my unhappy fate, and approved of my resolution to\\r\\nleave the country, as being perfectly well acquainted with the\\r\\nbarbarous disposition of my rival, â\\x80\\x9cwho, by this time,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9chas\\r\\nno doubt meditated a scheme of revenge. Indeed, I cannot see how you\\r\\nwill be able to elude his vengeance; being himself in the commission,\\r\\nhe will immediately grant warrants for apprehending you; and, as almost\\r\\nall the people in this country are dependent on him or his friend, it\\r\\nwill be impossible for you to find shelter among them. If you should be\\r\\napprehended, he will commit you to jail, where you may possibly in\\r\\ngreat misery languish till the next assizes, and then be transported\\r\\nfor assaulting a magistrate.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she thus warned me of my danger, we heard a knocking at the door,\\r\\nwhich threw us both into great consternation, as in all probability, it\\r\\nwas occasioned by my pursuers; whereupon this generous old lady,\\r\\nputting two guineas into my hand, with tears in her eyes, bade me, for\\r\\nGodâ\\x80\\x99s sake, get out at the back-door and consult my safety as\\r\\nProvidence should direct me. There was no time for deliberation. I\\r\\nfollowed her advice, and escaped by the benefit of a dark night to the\\r\\nseaside, where, while I ruminated on my next excursion, I was all of a\\r\\nsudden surrounded by armed men, who, having bound my hands and feet,\\r\\nbade me make no noise on pain of being shot, and carried me on board of\\r\\na vessel, which I soon perceived to be a smuggling cutter. This\\r\\ndiscovery gave me some satisfaction at first, because I concluded\\r\\nmyself safe from the resentment of Sir Timothy; but, when I found\\r\\nmyself in the hands of ruffians, who threatened to execute me for a\\r\\nspy, I would have thought myself happily quit for a yearâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nimprisonment, or even transportation. It was in vain for me to protest\\r\\nmy innocence: I could not persuade them that I had taken a solitary\\r\\nwalk to their haunt, at such an hour, merely for my own amusement; and\\r\\nI did not think it my interest to disclose the true cause of my\\r\\nretreat, because I was afraid they would have made their peace with\\r\\njustice by surrendering me to the penalty of the law. What confirmed\\r\\ntheir suspicion was, the appearance of a custom-house yacht, which gave\\r\\nthem chase, and had well nigh made a prize of their vessel; when they\\r\\nwere delivered from their fears by a thick fog, which effectually\\r\\nscreened them, and favoured their arrival at Boulogne. But, before they\\r\\ngot out of sight of their pursuer, they held a council of war about me,\\r\\nand some of the most ferocious among them would have thrown me\\r\\noverboard as a traitor who had betrayed them to their enemies; but\\r\\nothers, more considerate, alleged, that if they put me to death, and\\r\\nshould afterwards be taken, they could expect no mercy from the\\r\\nlegislature, which would never pardon outlawry aggravated by murder. It\\r\\nwas therefore determined by a plurality of votes, that I should be set\\r\\non shore in France, and left to find my way back to England, as I\\r\\nshould think proper, this being punishment sufficient for the bare\\r\\nsuspicion of a crime in itself not capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough this favourable determination gave me great pleasure, the\\r\\napprehension of being robbed would not suffer me to be perfectly at\\r\\nease. To prevent this calamity, as soon as I was untied, in consequence\\r\\nof the aforesaid decision, I tore a small hole in one of my stockings,\\r\\ninto which I dropped six guineas, reserving half a piece and some\\r\\nsilver in my pocket, that, finding something, they might not be tempted\\r\\nto make any further inquiry. This was a very necessary precaution, for,\\r\\nwhen we came within sight of the French shore, one of the smugglers\\r\\ntold me, I must pay for my passage. To this declaration I replied, that\\r\\nmy passage was none of my own seeking; therefore they could not expect\\r\\na reward from me for transporting me into a strange country by force.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94me!â\\x80\\x9d said the outlaw, â\\x80\\x9cnone of your palaver; but let me see what\\r\\nmoney you have got.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he thrust his hand into my pocket\\r\\nwithout any ceremony, and emptied it of the contents; then, casting an\\r\\neye at my hat and wig, which captivated his fancy, he took them off,\\r\\nclapping his own on my head, declared, that a fair exchange was no\\r\\nrobbery. I was fain to put up with this bargain, which was by no means\\r\\nfavourable to me; and a little while after we went all on shore\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nI resolved to take my leave of those desperadoes without much ceremony,\\r\\nwhen one of them cautioned me against appearing to their prejudice if\\r\\never I returned to England, unless I had a mind to be murdered; for\\r\\nwhich service, he assured me, the gang never wanted agents. I promised\\r\\nto observe his advice, and departed for the Upper Town, where I\\r\\ninquired for a cabaret, or public-house, into which I went, with an\\r\\nintention of taking some refreshment. In the kitchen, five Dutch\\r\\nsailors sat at breakfast with a large loaf, a firkin of butter, and a\\r\\nkeg of brandy, the bung of which they often applied to their mouths\\r\\nwith great perseverance and satisfaction. At some distance from them I\\r\\nperceived another person in the same garb, sitting in a pensive\\r\\nsolitary manner, entertaining himself with a whiff of tobacco, from the\\r\\nstump of a pipe as black as jet. The appearance of distress never\\r\\nfailed to attract my regard and compassion. I approached this forlorn\\r\\ntar with a view to offer him my assistance, and, notwithstanding the\\r\\nalteration of dress and disguise of a long beard, I discovered in him\\r\\nmy long lost and lamented uncle and benefactor, Lieutenant Bowling!\\r\\nGood Heaven! what were the agitations of my soul, between the joy of\\r\\nfinding again such a valuable friend, and the sorrow of seeing him in\\r\\nsuch a low condition! The tears gushed down my cheeks; I stood\\r\\nmotionless and silent for some time. At length, recovering the use of\\r\\nspeech, I exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cGracious God! Mr. Bowling!â\\x80\\x9d My uncle no sooner\\r\\nheard his name mentioned, than he started up, crying, with some\\r\\nsurprise, â\\x80\\x9cHolla!â\\x80\\x9d and, after having looked at me steadfastly, without\\r\\nbeing able to recollect me, said, â\\x80\\x9cDid you call me, brother,â\\x80\\x9d I told\\r\\nhim I had something extraordinary to communicate, and desired him to\\r\\ngive me the hearing for a few minutes in another room; but he would by\\r\\nno means consent to this proposal, saying, â\\x80\\x9cAvast there, friend: none\\r\\nof your tricks upon travellers;â\\x80\\x94if you have anything to say to me, do\\r\\nit above board;â\\x80\\x94you need not be afraid of being overheard;â\\x80\\x94here are\\r\\nnone who understand our lingo.â\\x80\\x9d Though I was loth to discover myself\\r\\nbefore company, I could no longer refrain from telling him I was his\\r\\nown nephew, Roderick Random. On this information, he considered me with\\r\\ngreat earnestness and astonishment, and, recalling my features, which,\\r\\nthough enlarged, were not entirely altered since he had seen me, came\\r\\nup, and shook me by the hand very cordially, protesting he was glad to\\r\\nsee me well. After some pause, he went on thus; â\\x80\\x9cAnd yet, my lad, I am\\r\\nsorry to see you under such colours; the more so, as it is not in my\\r\\npower, at present, to change them for the better, times being very hard\\r\\nwith me,â\\x80\\x9d With these words I could perceive a tear trickle down his\\r\\nfurrowed cheek, which affected me so much that I wept bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\nImagining my sorrow was the effect of my own misfortunes, he comforted\\r\\nme with observing, that life was a voyage in which we must expect to\\r\\nmeet with all weathers; sometimes was calm, sometimes rough; that a\\r\\nfair gale often succeeded a storm; that the wind did not always sit one\\r\\nway, and that despair signified nothing; that resolution and skill were\\r\\nbetter than a stout vessel: for why? because they require no carpenter,\\r\\nand grow stronger the more labour they undergo. I dried up my tears,\\r\\nwhich I assured him were not shed for my own distress, but for his, and\\r\\nbegged leave to accompany him into another room, where we could\\r\\nconverse more at our ease. There I recounted to him the ungenerous\\r\\nusage I had met with from Potion; at which relation he started up,\\r\\nstalked across the room three or four times in a great hurry, and,\\r\\ngrasping his cudgel, cried, â\\x80\\x9cI would I were alongside of himâ\\x80\\x94thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nallâ\\x80\\x94I would I were alongside of him!â\\x80\\x9d I then gave him a detail of my\\r\\nadventures and sufferings, which affected him more than I could have\\r\\nimagined; and concluded with telling him that Captain Oakun was still\\r\\nalive, and that he might return to England when he would to solicit his\\r\\naffairs, without danger or molestation. He was wonderfully pleased with\\r\\nthis piece of information, of which, however, he said he could not at\\r\\npresent avail himself, for want of money to pay for his passage to\\r\\nLondon. This objection I soon removed, by putting five guineas into his\\r\\nhand, and telling him I thought myself extremely happy in having an\\r\\nopportunity of manifesting my gratitude to him in his necessity. But it\\r\\nwas with the utmost difficulty I could prevail upon him to accept of\\r\\ntwo, which he affirmed were more than sufficient to defray the\\r\\nnecessary expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this friendly contest was over, he proposed we should have a mess\\r\\nof something; â\\x80\\x9cFor,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cit has been banyan day with me a great\\r\\nwhile. You must know I was shipwrecked, five days ago, near a place\\r\\ncalled Lisieux, in company with those Dutchmen who are now drinking\\r\\nbelow; and having but little money when I came ashore, it was soon\\r\\nspent, because I let them have share and share while it lasted.\\r\\nHowsomever, I should have remembered the old saying, every hog his own\\r\\napple; for when they found my hold unstowed, they went all hands to\\r\\nshooling and begging; and, because I would not take a spell at the same\\r\\nduty, refused to give me the least assistance; so that I have not broke\\r\\nbread these two days.â\\x80\\x9d I was shocked at the extremity of his distress,\\r\\nand ordered some bread, cheese, and wine, to be brought immediately, to\\r\\nallay his hunger, until a fricassee of chickens could be prepared. When\\r\\nhe had recruited his spirits with this homely fare, I desired to know\\r\\nthe particulars of his peregrination since the accident at Cape\\r\\nTiberoon, which were briefly these: The money he had about him being\\r\\nall spent at Port Louis, the civility and hospitality of the French\\r\\ncooled to such a degree, that he was obliged to list on board one of\\r\\ntheir kingâ\\x80\\x99s ships as a common foremast man, to prevent himself from\\r\\nstarving on shore. In this situation he continued two years, during\\r\\nwhich time he had acquired some knowledge of their language, and the\\r\\nreputation of a good seaman; the ship he belonged to was ordered home\\r\\nto France, where she was laid up as unfit for service, and he was\\r\\nreceived on board one of Monsieur Dâ\\x80\\x99Antinâ\\x80\\x99s squadron, in quality of\\r\\nquartermaster; which office he performed in a voyage to the West\\r\\nIndies, where he engaged with our ship, as before related; but his\\r\\nconscience upbraiding him for serving the one enemies of his country,\\r\\nhe quitted the ship at the same place where he first listed, and got to\\r\\nCuracoa in a Dutch vessel; there he bargained with a skipper, bound to\\r\\nEurope, to work for his passage to Holland, from whence he was in hopes\\r\\nof hearing from his friends in England; but was cast away, as he\\r\\nmentioned before, on the French coast, and must have been reduced to\\r\\nthe necessity of travelling on foot to Holland, and begging for his\\r\\nsubsistence on the road, or of entering on board of another French\\r\\nman-of-war, at the hazard of being treated as a deserter, if Providence\\r\\nhad not sent me to his succour. â\\x80\\x9cAnd now, my lad,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nthink I shall steer my course directly to London, where I do not doubt\\r\\nof being replaced, and of having the R taken off me by the Lords of the\\r\\nAdmiralty, to whom I intend to write a petition, setting forth my case;\\r\\nif I succeed, I shall have wherewithal to give you some assistance,\\r\\nbecause, when I left the ship, I had two yearsâ\\x80\\x99 pay due to me,\\r\\ntherefore I desire to know whither you are bound: and besides, perhaps,\\r\\nI may have interest enough to procure a warrant appointing you\\r\\nsurgeonâ\\x80\\x99s mate of the ship to which I shall belongâ\\x80\\x94for the beadle of\\r\\nthe Admiralty is my good friend: and he and one of the under clerks are\\r\\nsworn brothers, and that under clerk has a good deal to say with one of\\r\\nthe upper clerks, who is very well known to the under secretary, who,\\r\\nupon his recommendation, I hope, will recommend my affair to the first\\r\\nsecretary; and he again will speak to one of the lords in my behalf; so\\r\\nthat you see I do not want friends to assist me on occasion. As for the\\r\\nfellow Crampley, thoâ\\x80\\x99f I know him not, I am sure he is neither seaman\\r\\nnor officer, by what you have told me, or else he could never be so\\r\\nmuch mistaken in his reckoning, as to run the ship on shore on the\\r\\ncoast of Sussex before he believed himself in soundings; neither, when\\r\\nthat accident happened, would he have left the ship until she had been\\r\\nstove to pieces, especially when the tide was making; wherefore, by\\r\\nthis time, I do suppose, he has been tried by a court-martial, and\\r\\nexecuted for his cowardice and misconduct.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help smiling at the description of my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s ladder, by\\r\\nwhich he proposed to climb to the attention of the board of admiralty;\\r\\nand, though I knew the world too well to confide in such dependence\\r\\nmyself, I would not discourage him with doubts, but asked if he had no\\r\\nfriend in London, who would advance a small sum of money to enable him\\r\\nto appear as he ought, and make a small present to the under secretary,\\r\\nwho might possibly dispatch his business the sooner on that account. He\\r\\nscratched his head, and after some recollection, replied, â\\x80\\x9cWhy, yes, I\\r\\nbelieve Daniel Whipcord, the ship-chandler in Wapping, would not refuse\\r\\nme such a small matter. I know I can have what credit I want for\\r\\nlodging, liquor, and clothes; but as to money, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be positive. Had\\r\\nhonest Block been living, I should not have been at loss.â\\x80\\x9d I was\\r\\nheartily sorry to find a worthy man so destitute of friends, when he\\r\\nhad such need of them, and looked upon my own situation as less\\r\\nmiserable than his, because I was better acquainted with the\\r\\nselfishness and roguery of mankind, consequently less liable to\\r\\ndisappointment and imposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe takes his passage in a cutter for Dealâ\\x80\\x94we are accosted by a Priest,\\r\\nwho proves to be a Scotchmanâ\\x80\\x94his profession on friendshipâ\\x80\\x94he is\\r\\naffronted by the Lieutenant, who afterwards appeases him by\\r\\nsubmissionâ\\x80\\x94my uncle embarksâ\\x80\\x94I am introduced by a Priest to a Capuchin,\\r\\nin whose company I set out for Parisâ\\x80\\x94the character of my fellow\\r\\ntravellerâ\\x80\\x94on adventure on the roadâ\\x80\\x94I am shocked at his behaviour\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen our repast was ended, we walked down to the harbour, where we\\r\\nfound a cutter that was to sail for Deal in the evening, and Mr.\\r\\nBowling agreed for his passage. In the meantime, we sauntered about the\\r\\ntown to satisfy our curiosity, our conversation turning on the subject\\r\\nof my designs, which were not as yet fixed: neither can it be supposed\\r\\nthat my mind was at ease, when I found myself reduced almost to extreme\\r\\npoverty, in the midst of foreigners, among whom I had not one\\r\\nacquaintance to advise or befriend me. My uncle was sensible of my\\r\\nforlorn condition, and pressed me to accompany him to England, where he\\r\\ndid not doubt of finding some sort of provision for me; but besides the\\r\\nother reasons I had for avoiding that kingdom, I looked upon it, at\\r\\nthis time, as the worst country in the universe for a poor honest man\\r\\nto live in; and therefore determined to remain in France, at all\\r\\nevents.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was confirmed in this resolution by a reverend priest, who, passing\\r\\nby at this time, and overhearing us speak English, accosted us in the\\r\\nsame language, telling us he was our countryman, and wishing it might\\r\\nbe in his power to do us any service. We thanked this grave person for\\r\\nhis courteous offer, and invited him to drink a glass with us, which he\\r\\ndid not think proper to refuse, and we went altogether into a tavern of\\r\\nhis recommending. After having drunk to our healths in a bumper of good\\r\\nBurgundy, he began to inquire into our situation, particularly the\\r\\nplace of our nativity, which we no sooner named than he started up,\\r\\nand, wringing our hands with great fervour, shed a flood of tears,\\r\\ncrying, â\\x80\\x9cI come from the same part of the country! perhaps you are my\\r\\nown relations.â\\x80\\x9d I was on my guard against his caresses, which I\\r\\nsuspected very much, when I remembered the adventure of the\\r\\nmoney-dropper; but, without any appearance of diffidence, observed,\\r\\nthat, as he was born in that part of the country, he must certainly\\r\\nknow our families, which (howsoever mean our present appearance might\\r\\nbe) were none of the most obscure or inconsiderable. Then I discovered\\r\\nour names, to which I found he was no stranger; he had known my\\r\\ngrandfather personally; and, notwithstanding an absence of fifty years\\r\\nfrom Scotland, recounted so many particulars of the families in the\\r\\nneighbourhood, that my scruples were entirely removed, and I thought\\r\\nmyself happy in his acquaintance. In the course of our conversation, I\\r\\ndisclosed my condition without reserve, and displayed my talents to\\r\\nsuch advantage, that the old father looked upon me with admiration, and\\r\\nassured me, that, if I stayed in France, and listened to reason, I\\r\\ncould not fail of making my fortune, to which he would contribute all\\r\\nin his power.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy uncle began to be jealous of the Priestâ\\x80\\x99s insinuation, and very\\r\\nabruptly declared, that if ever I should renounce my religion, he would\\r\\nbreak off all connection and correspondence with me; for it was his\\r\\nopinion, that no honest man would swerve from his principles in which\\r\\nhe was bred, whether Turkish, Protestant, or Roman. The father,\\r\\naffronted at this declaration, with great vehemence began a long\\r\\ndiscourse, setting forth the danger of obstinacy, and shutting oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\neyes against the light. He said, that ignorance would be no plea\\r\\ntowards justification, when we had opportunities of being better\\r\\ninformed; and, that, if the minds of people had not been open to\\r\\nconviction, the Christian religion could not have been propagated in\\r\\nthe world, and we should now be in a state of Pagan darkness and\\r\\nbarbarity: he endeavoured to prove, by some texts of Scripture and many\\r\\nquotations from the Fathers, that the Pope was the successor of St.\\r\\nPeter, and vicar of Jesus Christ; that the church of Rome was the true,\\r\\nholy, catholic church; and that the Protestant faith was an impious\\r\\nheresy and damnable schism, by which many millions of souls would\\r\\nsuffer everlasting perdition. When he had finished his sermon, which I\\r\\nthought he pronounced with more zeal than discretion, he addressed\\r\\nhimself to my uncle, desired to know his objections to what had been\\r\\nsaid. The lieutenant, whose attention had been wholly engrossed by his\\r\\nown affairs, took the pipe out of his mouth, and replied, â\\x80\\x9cAs for me,\\r\\nfriend, dâ\\x80\\x99ye see, I have no objection to what you say; it may be either\\r\\ntruth or false, for what I know; I meddle with nobodyâ\\x80\\x99s affairs but my\\r\\nown; the gunner to his linstock, and the steersman to the helm, as the\\r\\nsaying is. I trust to no creed but the compass, and do unto every man\\r\\nas I would be done by; so that I defy the Pope, the Devil, and the\\r\\nPretender; and hope to be saved as well as another.â\\x80\\x9d This association\\r\\nof persons gave great offence to the friar, who protested, in a mighty\\r\\npassion, that if Mr. Bowling had not been his countryman, he would have\\r\\ncaused him to be imprisoned for his insolence; I ventured to disapprove\\r\\nof my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s rashness, and appeased the old gentleman, by assuring him\\r\\nthere was no offence intended by my kinsman, who, by this time sensible\\r\\nof his error, shook the injured party by the hand, and asked pardon for\\r\\nthe freedom he had taken. Matters being amicably compromised, he\\r\\ninvited us to come and see him in the afternoon at the convent to which\\r\\nhe belonged, and took his leave for the present; when my uncle\\r\\nrecommended it strongly to me to persevere in the religion of my\\r\\nforefathers, whatever advantages might propose to myself by a change,\\r\\nwhich could not fail of disgracing myself, and dishonouring my family.\\r\\nI assured him no consideration would induce me to forfeit his\\r\\nfriendship and good opinion on that score; at which assurance he\\r\\ndiscovered great satisfaction, and put me in mind of dinner, which we\\r\\nimmediately bespoke, and when it was ready, ate together.\\r\\n\\r\\nI imagined my acquaintance with the Scottish priest if properly\\r\\nmanaged, might turn out to my advantage, and therefore resolved to\\r\\ncultivate it as much as I could. With this view we visited him at his\\r\\nconvent, according to his invitation, where he treated us with wine and\\r\\nsweetmeats, and showed us everything that was remarkable in the\\r\\nmonastery. Having been thus entertained, we took our leave, though not\\r\\nbefore I had promised to see him next day, and the time fixed for my\\r\\nuncleâ\\x80\\x99s embarking being come, I accompanied him to the harbour, and saw\\r\\nhim on board. We parted not without tears, after we had embraced and\\r\\nwished one another all manner of prosperity: and he entreated me to\\r\\nwrite to him often, directing to Lieutenant Bowling, at the sign of the\\r\\nUnion Flag, near the Hermitage, London.\\r\\n\\r\\nI returned to the house in which we had met, where I passed the night\\r\\nin a very solitary manner, reflecting on the severity of my fate, and\\r\\nendeavouring to project some likely scheme of life for the future; but\\r\\nmy invention failed me; I saw nothing but insurmountable difficulties\\r\\nin my way, and was ready to despair at the miserable prospect! That I\\r\\nmight not, however, neglect any probable reason, I got up in the\\r\\nmorning, and went directly to the father, whose advice and assistance I\\r\\nimplored. He received me very kindly, and gave me to understand, that\\r\\nthere was one way of life in which a person of my talents could not\\r\\nfail of making a great figure. I guessed his meaning, and told him,\\r\\nonce for all, I was fully determined against any alteration in point of\\r\\nreligion; therefore if his proposal regarded the church, he might save\\r\\nhimself the trouble of explaining it. He shook his head and sighed,\\r\\nsaying, â\\x80\\x9cAh! son, son, what a glorious prospect is here spoiled by your\\r\\nstubborn prejudice! Suffer yourself to be persuaded by reason, and\\r\\nconsult your temporal welfare, as well as the concerns of your eternal\\r\\nsoul. I can, by my interest procure your admission as a noviciate to\\r\\nthis convent, where I will superintend and direct you with a truly\\r\\npaternal affection.â\\x80\\x9d Then he launched out into the praises of a\\r\\nmonastic life, which no noise disturbs, no cares molest, and no danger\\r\\ninvadesâ\\x80\\x94where the heart is weaned from carnal attachments, the grosser\\r\\nappetite subdued and chastised, and the soul wafted to divine regions\\r\\nof philosophy and truth, on the wing of studious contemplation. But his\\r\\neloquence was lost upon me, whom two considerations enabled to\\r\\nwithstand his temptation; namely, my promise to my uncle, and my\\r\\naversion to an ecclesiastical life; for as to the difference of\\r\\nreligion, I looked upon it as a thing of too small moment to come in\\r\\ncompetition with a manâ\\x80\\x99s fortune. Finding me immovable on this head, he\\r\\ntold me, he was more sorry than offended at my noncompliance, and still\\r\\nready to employ his good offices in my behalf. â\\x80\\x9cThe same erroneous\\r\\nmaxims,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat obstruct your promotion in the church, will\\r\\ninfallibly prevent your advancement in the army; but, if you can brook\\r\\nthe condition of a servant, I am acquainted with some people of rank at\\r\\nVersailles, to whom I can give you letters of recommendation, that you\\r\\nmay be entertained by some one of them in quality of maitre dâ\\x80\\x99hotel;\\r\\nand I do not doubt that your qualifications will soon entitle you to a\\r\\nbetter provision.â\\x80\\x9d I embraced his offer with great eagerness, and he\\r\\nappointed me to come back in the afternoon, when he would not only give\\r\\nme letters, but likewise introduce me to a capuchin of his\\r\\nacquaintance, who intended to set out for Paris next morning in whose\\r\\ncompany I might travel, without being at the expense of one livre\\r\\nduring the whole journey. This piece of good news gave me infinite\\r\\npleasure; I acknowledged my obligation to the benevolent father in the\\r\\nmost grateful expressions; and he performed his promise to a tittle, in\\r\\ndelivering the letters, and making me acquainted with the capuchin,\\r\\nwith whom I departed next morning by break of day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long before I discovered my fellow traveller to be a merry\\r\\nfacetious fellow, who, notwithstanding his profession and appearance of\\r\\nmortification, loved good eating and drinking better than his rosary,\\r\\nand paid more adoration to a pretty girl than to the Virgin Mary, or\\r\\nSt. Genevieve. He was a thick brawny young man, with red eyebrows, a\\r\\nhook nose, a face covered with freckles; and his name was Frere\\r\\nBalthazar. His order did not permit him to wear linen, so that, having\\r\\nlittle occasion to undress himself, he was none of the cleanliest\\r\\nanimals in the world; and his constitution was naturally so strongly\\r\\nscented that I always thought it convenient to keep to the windward of\\r\\nhim in our march. As he was perfectly well known on the road, we fared\\r\\nsumptuously without any cost, and the fatigue of our journey was much\\r\\nalleviated by the good humour of my companion, who sang an infinite\\r\\nnumber of catches on the subjects of love and wine. We took up our\\r\\nlodging the first night at a peasantâ\\x80\\x99s house not far from Abbeville,\\r\\nwhere we were entertained with an excellent ragout, cooked by our\\r\\nlandlordâ\\x80\\x99s daughters, one of whom was very handsome. After having eaten\\r\\nheartily and drank a sufficient quantity of small wine, we were\\r\\nconducted to a barn, where we found a couple of carpets spread upon\\r\\nclean straw for our reception. We had not lain in this situation above\\r\\nhalf-an-hour, when we heard somebody knock softly at the door, upon\\r\\nwhich Balthazar got up, and let in our hostâ\\x80\\x99s two daughters, who wanted\\r\\nto have some private conversation with him in the dark. When they had\\r\\nwhispered together some time, the capuchin came to me, and asked if I\\r\\nwas insensible to love, and so hard-hearted as to refuse a share of my\\r\\nbed to a pretty maid who had a tendre for me? I must own to my shame,\\r\\nthat I suffered myself to be overcome by my passion, and with great\\r\\neagerness seized the occasion, when I understood that the amiable\\r\\nNanette was to be my bedfellow. In vain did my reason suggest the\\r\\nrespect that I owed to my dear mistress Narcissa; the idea of that\\r\\nlovely charmer rather increased than allayed the ferment of my spirits;\\r\\nand the young paysanne had no reason to complain of my remembrance.\\r\\nEarly in the morning, the kind creatures left us to our repose, which\\r\\nlasted till eight oâ\\x80\\x99clock when we got up, and were treated at breakfast\\r\\nwith chocolate and lâ\\x80\\x99eau-de-vie by our paramours, of whom we took a\\r\\ntender leave, after my companion had confessed and given them\\r\\nabsolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we proceeded on our journey, the conversation turned upon the\\r\\nnightâ\\x80\\x99s adventure, being introduced by the capuchin, who asked me how I\\r\\nliked my lodging; I declared my satisfaction, and talked in rapture of\\r\\nthe agreeable Nanette, at which he shook his head, and smiling said,\\r\\nshe was a morceau pour la bonne bouche. â\\x80\\x9cI never valued myself,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncontinued he, â\\x80\\x9cupon anything so much as the conquest of Nanette; and,\\r\\nvanity apart, I have been pretty fortunate in my amours.â\\x80\\x9d This\\r\\ninformation shocked me not a little, as I was well convinced of his\\r\\nintimacy with her sister; and though I did not care to tax him with\\r\\ndownright incest, I professed my astonishment at his last nightâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nchoice, when, I supposed, the other was at his devotion. To this hint\\r\\nhe answered that, besides his natural complaisance to the sex, he had\\r\\nanother reason to distribute his favours equally between them, namely,\\r\\nto preserve peace in the family, which could not otherwise be\\r\\nmaintained; that, moreover, Nanette had conceived an affection for me,\\r\\nand he loved her too well to balk her inclination; more especially,\\r\\nwhen he had an opportunity of obliging his friend at the same time. I\\r\\nthanked him for this instance of his friendship, though I was extremely\\r\\ndisgusted at his want of delicacy, and cursed the occasion that threw\\r\\nme in his way. Libertine as I was, I could not bear to see a man behave\\r\\nso wide of the character he assumed. I looked upon him as a person of\\r\\nvery little worth or honesty, and should even have kept a wary eye upon\\r\\nmy pocket, if I had thought he could have had any temptation to steal.\\r\\nBut I could not conceive the use of money to a capuchin, who is\\r\\nobliged, by the rules of his order, to appear like a beggar, and enjoy\\r\\nall other necessaries of life gratis; besides, my fellow traveller\\r\\nseemed to be of a complexion too careless and sanguine to give me any\\r\\napprehension on that score; so that I proceeded with great confidence,\\r\\nin expectation of being soon at my journeyâ\\x80\\x99s end.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe lodge at a House near Amiens, where I am robbed by the Capuchin, who\\r\\nescapes while I am asleepâ\\x80\\x94I go to Noyons in search of him, but without\\r\\nSuccessâ\\x80\\x94make my Condition known to several People, but find no\\r\\nReliefâ\\x80\\x94grow desperateâ\\x80\\x94find a Company of Soldiersâ\\x80\\x94Enlist in the Regiment\\r\\nof Picardyâ\\x80\\x94we are ordered into Germanyâ\\x80\\x94I find the Fatigues of the March\\r\\nalmost intolerableâ\\x80\\x94Quarrel with my Comrade in a dispute about\\r\\nPoliticsâ\\x80\\x94he challenges me to the Fieldâ\\x80\\x94wounds and disarms me\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third night of our pilgrimage we passed at a house near Amiens,\\r\\nwhere being unknown, we supped upon indifferent fare and sour wine, and\\r\\nwere fain to be in a garret upon an old mattress, which, I believe had\\r\\nbeen in the possession of ten thousand myriads of fleas time out of\\r\\nmind. We did not invade their territory with impunity; in less than a\\r\\nminute we were attacked by stings innumerable, in spite of which,\\r\\nhowever, I fell fast asleep, being excessively fatigued with our dayâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmarch, and did not wake till nine next morning, when, seeing myself\\r\\nalone, I started up in a terrible fright, and, examining my pockets,\\r\\nfound my presaging fear too true! My companion had made free with my\\r\\ncash, and left me to seek my way to Paris by myself! I ran down stairs\\r\\nimmediately; and, with a look full of grief and amazement, inquired for\\r\\nthe mendicant, who, they gave me to understand, had set out four hours\\r\\nbefore, after having told them I was a little indisposed, and desired I\\r\\nmight not be disturbed, but be informed when I should wake, that he had\\r\\ntaken the road to Noyons, where he would wait for my coming, at the Coq\\r\\ndâ\\x80\\x99Or. I spoke not a word, but with a heavy heart directed my course to\\r\\nthat place, at which I arrived in the afternoon, fainting with\\r\\nweariness and hunger; but learned to my utter confusion, that no such\\r\\nperson had been there! It was happy for me that I had a good deal of\\r\\nresentment in my constitution, which animated me on such occasions\\r\\nagainst the villainy of mankind, and enabled me to bear misfortunes,\\r\\notherwise intolerable. Boiling with indignation, I discovered to the\\r\\nhost my deplorable condition, and inveighed with great bitterness\\r\\nagainst the treachery of Balthazar; at which he shrugged up his\\r\\nshoulders, and with a peculiar grimace on his countenance, said, he was\\r\\nsorry for my misfortune, but there was no remedy like patience. At that\\r\\ninstant some guests arrived, to whom he hastened to offer his service,\\r\\nleaving me mortified at his indifference, and fully persuaded that an\\r\\ninnkeeper is the same sordid animal all the world over.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I stood in the porch forlorn and undetermined, venting\\r\\nejaculations of curses against the thief who had robbed me, and the old\\r\\npriest who recommended him to my friendship, a young gentleman richly\\r\\ndressed, attended by a valet de chambre and two servants in livery,\\r\\narrived at the inn. I thought I perceived a great deal of sweetness and\\r\\ngood-nature in his countenance; therefore he had no sooner alighted\\r\\nthan I accosted him, and, in a few words, explained my situation: he\\r\\nlistened with great politeness, and, when I made an end of my story,\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x9cWell, monsieur, what would you have me to do?â\\x80\\x9d I was effectually\\r\\nabashed at this interrogation, which, I believe, no man of common sense\\r\\nor generosity could make, and made no other compliment than a low bow:\\r\\nhe returned the compliment still lower, and tripped into an apartment,\\r\\nwhile the landlord let me know that my standing there to interrupt\\r\\ncompany gave offence, and might do him infinite prejudice. He had no\\r\\noccasion to repeat his insinuation; I moved from the place immediately,\\r\\nand was so much transported with grief, anger, and disdain, that a\\r\\ntorrent of blood gushed from my nostrils. In this ecstacy, I quitted\\r\\nNoyons, and betook myself to the fields, where I wandered about like\\r\\none distracted, till my spirits were quite exhausted, and I was obliged\\r\\nto throw myself down at the root of a tree, to rest my wearied limbs.\\r\\nHere my rage forsook me: I began to feel the importunate cravings of\\r\\nnature, and relapsed into silent sorrow and melancholy reflection. I\\r\\nrevolved all the crimes I had been guilty of and found them too few and\\r\\nvenial, that I could not comprehend the justice of that Providence,\\r\\nwhich, after having exposed me to so much wretchedness and danger, left\\r\\nme a prey to famine at last in a foreign country, where I had not one\\r\\nfriend or acquaintance to close my eyes, and do the last offices of\\r\\nhumanity to my miserable carcass. A thousand times I wished myself a\\r\\nbear, that I might retreat to woods and deserts, far from the\\r\\ninhospitable haunts of man, where I could live by my own talents,\\r\\nindependent of treacherous friends and supercilious scorn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I lay in this manner, groaning over my hapless fate, I heard the\\r\\nsound of a violin, and raising my head, perceived a company of men and\\r\\nwomen dancing on the grass at some distance from me. I looked upon this\\r\\nto be a favourable season for distress to attract compassion, when\\r\\nevery selfish thought is banished, and the heart dilated with mirth and\\r\\nsocial joy; wherefore I got up, and approached those happy people, whom\\r\\nI soon discovered to be a party of soldiers, with their wives and\\r\\nchildren, unbending and diverting themselves at this rate, after the\\r\\nfatigue of a march. I had never before seen such a parcel of scarecrows\\r\\ntogether, neither could I reconcile their meagre and gaunt looks, their\\r\\nsqualid and ragged attire, and every other external symptom of extreme\\r\\nwoe, with this appearance of festivity. I saluted them, however, and\\r\\nwas received with great politeness; after which they formed a ring, and\\r\\ndanced around me. This jollity had a wonderful effect upon my spirits.\\r\\nI was infected with their gaiety, and in spite of my dismal situation,\\r\\nforgot my cares, and joined in their extravagance. When we had\\r\\nrecreated ourselves a good while at this diversion, the ladies spread\\r\\ntheir manteaus on the ground, upon which they emptied their knapsacks\\r\\nof some onions, coarse bread, and a few flasks of poor wine: being\\r\\ninvited to a share of the banquet, I sat down with the rest, and, in\\r\\nthe whole course of my life, never made a more comfortable meal. When\\r\\nour repast was ended, we got up again to dance, and, now that I found\\r\\nmyself refreshed I behaved to the admiration of everybody; I was loaded\\r\\nwith a thousand compliments and professions of friendship: the men\\r\\ncommended my person and agility, and the women were loud in the praise\\r\\nof my bonne grace; the sergeant in particular expressed so much regard\\r\\nfor me, and described the pleasures of a soldierâ\\x80\\x99s life to me with so\\r\\nmuch art, that I began to listen to his proposal of enlisting me in the\\r\\nservice; and the more I considered my own condition, the more I was\\r\\nconvinced of the necessity I was under to come to a speedy\\r\\ndetermination.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving, therefore, maturely weighed the circumstances pro and con I\\r\\nsignified my consent, and was admitted into the regiment of Picardy,\\r\\nsaid to be the oldest corps in Europe. The company to which this\\r\\ncommander belonged was quartered at a village not far off, whither we\\r\\nmarched next day, and I was presented to my captain, who seemed very\\r\\nwell pleased with my appearance, gave me a crown to drink, and ordered\\r\\nme to be accommodated with clothes, arms, and accoutrements. Then I\\r\\nsold my livery suit, purchased linen, and, as I was at great pains to\\r\\nlearn the exercise, in a very short time became a complete soldier.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long before we received orders to join several more\\r\\nregiments, and march with all expedition into Germany, in order to\\r\\nreinforce Mareschal Duc de Noailles, who was then encamped with his\\r\\narmy on the side of the river Mayne, to watch the motions of the\\r\\nEnglish, Hanoverians, Austrians, and Hessians, under the command of the\\r\\nEarl of Stair. We began our march accordingly, and then I became\\r\\nacquainted with that part of a soldierâ\\x80\\x99s life to which I had been\\r\\nhitherto a stranger. It is impossible to describe the hunger and thirst\\r\\nI sustained, and the fatigue I underwent in a march of so many hundred\\r\\nmiles; during which, I was so much chafed with the heat and motion of\\r\\nmy limbs, that in a very short time the inside of my thighs and legs\\r\\nwere deprived of skin, and I proceeded in the utmost torture. This\\r\\nmisfortune I owed to the plumpness of my constitution, which I cursed,\\r\\nand envied the withered condition of my comrades, whose bodies could\\r\\nnot spare juice enough to supply a common issue, and were indeed proof\\r\\nagainst all manner of friction. The continual pain I felt made me\\r\\nfretful, and my peevishness was increased by the mortification of my\\r\\npride in seeing those miserable wretches, whom a hard gale of wind\\r\\nwould have scattered through the air like chaff, bear those toils with\\r\\nalacrity under which I was ready to sink.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, while we enjoyed a halt, and the soldiers with their wives had\\r\\ngone out to dance, according to custom, my comrade stayed at home with\\r\\nme on pretence of friendship, and insulted me with his pity and\\r\\nconsolation! He told me that, though I was young and tender at present,\\r\\nI should soon be seasoned to the service; and he did not doubt but I\\r\\nshould have the honour to contribute in some measure to the glory of\\r\\nthe king. â\\x80\\x9cHave courage, therefore, my child,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cand pray to\\r\\nthe good God, that you may be as happy as I am, who have had the honour\\r\\nof serving Louis the Great, and of receiving many wounds, in helping to\\r\\nestablish his glory.â\\x80\\x9d When I looked upon the contemptible object that\\r\\npronounced these words, I was amazed at the infatuation that possessed\\r\\nhim; and could not help expressing my astonishment at the absurdity of\\r\\na rational who thinks himself highly honoured, in being permitted to\\r\\nencounter abject poverty, oppression, famine, disease, mutilation, and\\r\\nevident death merely to gratify the vicious ambition of a prince, by\\r\\nwhom his sufferings were disregarded, and his name utterly unknown. I\\r\\nobserved that, if his situation were the consequence of compulsion, I\\r\\nwould praise his patience and fortitude in bearing his lot: if he had\\r\\ntaken up arms in defence of his injured country, he was to be applauded\\r\\nfor his patriotism: or if he had fled to this way of life as a refuge\\r\\nfrom a greater evil, he was justifiable in his own conscience (though I\\r\\ncould have no notion of misery more extreme than he suffered); but to\\r\\nput his condition on the footing of conducing to the glory of his\\r\\nprince, was no more than professing himself a desperate slave, who\\r\\nvoluntarily underwent the utmost wretchedness and peril, and committed\\r\\nthe most flagrant crimes, to soothe the barbarous pride of a\\r\\nfellow-creature, his superior in nothing but the power he derived from\\r\\nthe submission of such wretches as him. The soldier was very much\\r\\naffronted at the liberty I took with his king, which, he said, nothing\\r\\nbut my ignorance could excuse: he affirmed that the characters of\\r\\nprinces were sacred, and ought not to be profaned by the censure of\\r\\ntheir subjects, who were bound by their allegiance to obey their\\r\\ncommands, of what nature soever, without scruple or repining; and\\r\\nadvised me to correct the rebellious principles I had imbibed among the\\r\\nEnglish, who, for their insolence to their kings, were notorious all\\r\\nover the world, even to a proverb.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vindication of my countrymen, I repeated all the arguments commonly\\r\\nused to prove that every man has a natural right to liberty; that\\r\\nallegiance and protection are reciprocal; that, when the mutual tie is\\r\\nbroken by the tyranny of the king, he is accountable to the people for\\r\\nhis breach of contract, and subject to the penalties of the law; and\\r\\nthat those insurrections of the English, which are branded with the\\r\\nname of rebellion by the slaves of arbitrary power, were no other than\\r\\nglorious efforts to rescue that independence which was their\\r\\nbirthright, from the ravenous claws of usurping ambition. The\\r\\nFrenchman, provoked at the little deference I paid to the kingly name,\\r\\nlost all patience, and reproached me in such a manner that my temper\\r\\nforsook me, I clenched my fist, with an intention to give him a hearty\\r\\nbox on the ear. Perceiving my design, he started back and demanded a\\r\\nparley; upon which I checked my indignation, and he gave me to\\r\\nunderstand that a Frenchman never forgave a blow; therefore, if I were\\r\\nnot weary of my life, I would do well to spare him that mortification,\\r\\nand do him the honour of measuring his sword with mine, like a\\r\\ngentleman. I took his advice and followed him to a field hard by, where\\r\\nindeed I was ashamed at the pitiful figure of my antagonist, who was a\\r\\npoor little shivering creature, decrepit with age, and blind of one\\r\\neye. But I soon found the folly of judging from appearances; being at\\r\\nthe second pass wounded in the sword hand, and immediately disarmed\\r\\nwith such a jerk, that I thought the joint was dislocated. I was no\\r\\nless confounded than enraged at this event, especially as my adversary\\r\\ndid not bear his success with all the moderation that might have been\\r\\nexpected; for he insisted upon my asking pardon for affronting his king\\r\\nand him. This proposal I would by no means comply with, but told him,\\r\\nit was a mean condescension, which no gentleman in his circumstances\\r\\nought to propose, nor any in my situation ought to perform; and that,\\r\\nif he persisted in his ungenerous demand, I would in my turn claim\\r\\nsatisfaction with my musket, when we should be more upon a par than\\r\\nwith the sword, of which he seemed so much master.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to be revenged, I learn the Science of Defenceâ\\x80\\x94we join\\r\\nMareschal Duc de Noailles, are engaged with the Allies of Dettingen,\\r\\nand put to flightâ\\x80\\x94the behaviour of the French soldiers on that\\r\\noccasionâ\\x80\\x94I industriously seek another combat with the old Gascon, and\\r\\nvanquish him in my turnâ\\x80\\x94our regiment is put into Winter Quarters at\\r\\nRheims, where I find my friend Strapâ\\x80\\x94our Recognitionâ\\x80\\x94he supplies me\\r\\nwith Money, and procures my Dischargeâ\\x80\\x94we take a trip to Paris; from\\r\\nwhence, by the way of Flanders, we set out for London; where we safely\\r\\narrive\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was disconcerted at this declaration, to which he made no reply, but\\r\\nrepaired to the dancers, among whom he recounted his victory with many\\r\\nexaggerations and gasconades; while I, taking up my sword, went to my\\r\\nquarters, and examined my wound, which I found was of no consequence.\\r\\nThe same day an Irish drummer, having heard of my misfortune, visited\\r\\nme, and after having condoled me on the chance of war, gave me to\\r\\nunderstand, that he was master of the sword, and would in a very short\\r\\ntime instruct me so thoroughly in that noble science, that I should be\\r\\nable to chastise the old Gascon for his insolent boasting at my\\r\\nexpense. This friendly office he proffered on pretence of the regard he\\r\\nhad for his countrymen; but I afterwards learned the true motive was no\\r\\nother than a jealousy he entertained of a correspondence between the\\r\\nFrenchman and his wife, which he did not think proper to resent in\\r\\nperson. Be this as it will, I accepted his offer and practised his\\r\\nlessons with such application, that I soon believed myself a match for\\r\\nmy conqueror. In the meantime we continued our march, and arrived at\\r\\nthe Camp of Mareschal Noailles the night before the battle at\\r\\nDettingen: notwithstanding the fatigue we had undergone, our regiment\\r\\nwas one of those that were ordered next day to cross the river, under\\r\\nthe command of the Duc de Grammont, to take possession of a narrow\\r\\ndefile, through which the allies must of necessity have passed at a\\r\\ngreat disadvantage, or remain where they were, and perish for want of\\r\\nprovision, if they would not condescend to surrender at discretion. How\\r\\nthey suffered themselves to be pent up in this manner it is not my\\r\\nprovince to relate; I shall only observe that, when we had taken\\r\\npossession of our ground, I heard an old officer in conversation with\\r\\nanother express a surprise at the conduct of Lord Stair, who had the\\r\\nreputation of a good general. But it seems, at this time, that nobleman\\r\\nwas overruled, and only acted in an inferior character; so that no part\\r\\nof the blame could be imputed to him, who declared his disapprobation\\r\\nof the step, in consequence of which the whole army was in the utmost\\r\\ndanger; but Providence or destiny acted miracles in their behalf, by\\r\\ndisposing the Duc de Grammont to quit his advantageous post, pass the\\r\\ndefile, and attack the English, who were drawn up in order of battle on\\r\\nthe plain, and who handled us so roughly that, after having lost a\\r\\ngreat number of men, we turned our backs without ceremony, and fled\\r\\nwith such precipitation that many hundreds perished in the river\\r\\nthrough pure fear and confusion: for the enemy were so generous that\\r\\nthey did not pursue us one inch of ground; and, if our consternation\\r\\nwould have permitted, we might have retreated with great order and\\r\\ndeliberation. But, notwithstanding the royal clemency of the king of\\r\\nGreat Britain, who headed the allies in person, and, no doubt, put a\\r\\nstop to the carnage, our loss amounted to five thousand men, among whom\\r\\nwere many officers of distinction. Our miscarriage opened a passage for\\r\\nthe foe to Haynau, whither they immediately marched, leaving their sick\\r\\nand wounded to the care of the French, who next day took possession of\\r\\nthe field of battle, buried the dead, and treated the living with\\r\\nhumanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis circumstance was a great consolation to us, who thence took\\r\\noccasion to claim the victory; and the genius of the French nation\\r\\nnever appeared more conspicuous than now, in the rhodomontades they\\r\\nuttered on the subject of their generosity and courage. Every man (by\\r\\nhis own account) performed feats that eclipsed all the heroes of\\r\\nantiquity. One compared himself to a lion retiring at leisure from his\\r\\ncowardly pursuers, who keep at a wary distance, and gall him with their\\r\\ndarts. Another likened himself to a bear that retreats with his face to\\r\\nthe enemy, who dare not assail him; and the third assumed the character\\r\\nof a desperate stag, that turns upon the hounds and keeps them at bay.\\r\\nThere was not a private soldier engaged who had not by the prowess of\\r\\nhis single arm demolished a whole platoon, or put a squadron of horse\\r\\nto flight; and, among others, the meagre Gascon extolled his exploits\\r\\nabove those of Hercules or Charlemagne. As I still retained my\\r\\nresentment for the disgrace I suffered in my last rencontre with him,\\r\\nand, now that I thought myself qualified, longed for an opportunity to\\r\\nretrieve my honour, I magnified the valour of the English with all the\\r\\nhyperboles I could imagine, and described the pusillanimity of the\\r\\nFrench in the same style, comparing them to hares flying before\\r\\ngreyhounds, or mice pursued by cats; and passed an ironical compliment\\r\\non the speed he exerted in his flight, which, considering his age and\\r\\ninfirmities I said was surprising. He was stung to the quick by this\\r\\nsarcasm, and, with an air of threatening disdain, bade me know myself\\r\\nbetter, and remember the correction I had already received from him for\\r\\nmy insolence; for he might not always be in the humour of sparing a\\r\\nwretch who abused his goodness. To this inuendo I made no reply but by\\r\\na kick on the breech, which overturned him in an instant. He started up\\r\\nwith wonderful agility, and, drawing his sword, attacked me with great\\r\\nfury. Several people interposed, but, when he informed them of its\\r\\nbeing an affair of honour, they retired, and left us to decide the\\r\\nbattle by ourselves. I sustained his onset with little damage, having\\r\\nonly received a small scratch on my right shoulder, and, seeing his\\r\\nbreath and vigour almost exhausted, assaulted him in my turn, closed\\r\\nwith him, and wrested his sword out of his hand in the struggle. Having\\r\\nthus acquired the victory, I desired him to beg his life; to which\\r\\ndemand he made no answer, but shrugged up his shoulders to his ears,\\r\\nexpanded his hands, elevated the skin on his forehead and eyebrows, and\\r\\ndepressed the corners of his mouth in such a manner, that I could\\r\\nscarce refrain from laughing aloud at his grotesque appearance. That I\\r\\nmight, however, mortify his vanity, which triumphed without bounds over\\r\\nmy misfortune, I thrust his sword up to the hilt in something (it was\\r\\nnot a tansy), that lay smoking on the plain, and joined the rest of the\\r\\nsoldiers with an air of tranquillity and indifference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing more of moment attempted by either of the armies\\r\\nduring the remaining part of the campaign, which being ended, the\\r\\nEnglish marched back to the Netherlands; part of our army was detached\\r\\nto French Flanders, and our regiment ordered into winter quarters in\\r\\nChampagne. It was the fate of the grenadier company, to which I now\\r\\nbelonged, to lie at Rheims, where I found myself in the utmost want of\\r\\neverything, my pay, which amounted to five sols a day, far from\\r\\nsupplying me with necessaries, being scarce sufficient to procure a\\r\\nwretched subsistence to keep soul and body together; so that I was, by\\r\\nhunger and hard duty, brought down to the meagre condition of my\\r\\nfellow-soldiers, and my linen reduced from three tolerable shirts to\\r\\ntwo pair of sleeves and necks, the bodies having been long ago\\r\\nconverted into spatterdaches; and after all, I was better provided than\\r\\nany private man in the regiment. In this urgency of my affairs, I wrote\\r\\nto my uncle in England, though my hopes from that quarter were not at\\r\\nall sanguine, for the reasons I have already explained; and in the\\r\\nmeantime had recourse to my old remedy patience, consoling myself with\\r\\nthe flattering suggestions of a lively imagination, that never\\r\\nabandoned me in my distress.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, while I stood sentinel at the gate of a general officer, a\\r\\ncertain nobleman came to the door, followed by a gentleman in mourning,\\r\\nto whom, at parting, I heard him say, â\\x80\\x9cYou may depend upon my good\\r\\noffices.â\\x80\\x9d This assurance was answered by a low bow of the person in\\r\\nblack, who, turning to go away, discovered to me the individual\\r\\ncountenance of my old friend and adherent Strap. I was so much\\r\\nastonished at the sight, that I lost the power of utterance, and,\\r\\nbefore I could recollect myself, he was gone without taking any notice\\r\\nof me. Indeed, had he stayed, I scarcely should have ventured to accost\\r\\nhim; because, though I was perfectly well acquainted with the features\\r\\nof his face, I could not be positively certain as to the rest of his\\r\\nperson, which was very much altered for the better since he left me at\\r\\nLondon, neither could I conceive by which means he was enabled to\\r\\nappear in the sphere of a gentleman, to which, while I knew him, he had\\r\\nnot even the ambition to aspire. But I was too much concerned in the\\r\\naffair to neglect further information, and therefore took the first\\r\\nopportunity of asking the porter if he knew the gentleman to whom the\\r\\nmarquis spoke. The Swiss told me his name was Monsieur dâ\\x80\\x99Estrapes, that\\r\\nhe had been valet-de-chambre to an English gentleman lately deceased,\\r\\nand that he was very much regarded by the marquis for his fidelity to\\r\\nhis master, between whom and that nobleman a very intimate friendship\\r\\nhad subsisted. Nothing could be more agreeable to me than this piece of\\r\\nintelligence, which banished all doubt of its being my friend, who had\\r\\nfound means to frenchify his name as well as his behaviour since we\\r\\nparted. As soon, therefore, as I was relieved, I went to his lodging,\\r\\naccording to a direction given me by the Swiss, and had the good\\r\\nfortune to find him at home. That I might surprise him the more, I\\r\\nconcealed my name and business, and only desired the servant of the\\r\\nhouse to tell Monsieur dâ\\x80\\x99Estrapes that I begged the honour of\\r\\nhalf-an-hourâ\\x80\\x99s conversation with him. He was confounded and dismayed at\\r\\nthis message, when he understood it was sent by a soldier; though he\\r\\nwas conscious to himself of no crime, all that he had heard of the\\r\\nBastille appeared to his imagination with aggravated horror, but it was\\r\\nnot before I had waited a considerable time that he had resolution\\r\\nenough to bid the servant show me up-stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I entered his chamber, he returned my bow with great civility, and\\r\\nendeavoured, with forced complaisance, to disguise his fear, which\\r\\nappeared in the paleness of his face, the wildness of his looks, and\\r\\nthe shaking of his limbs. I was diverted at his consternation, which\\r\\nredoubled, when I told him in French, I had business for his private\\r\\near and demanded a particular audience. The valet being withdrawn, I\\r\\nasked in the same language if his name was dâ\\x80\\x99Estrapes, to which he\\r\\nanswered with a faltering tongue, â\\x80\\x9cThe same, at your service.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAre you\\r\\na Frenchman?â\\x80\\x9d Said I. â\\x80\\x9cI have not the honour of being a Frenchman\\r\\nborn,â\\x80\\x9d replied he, â\\x80\\x9cbut I have an infinite veneration for the country.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nI then desired he would do me the honour to look at me, which he no\\r\\nsooner did than, struck with my appearance, he started back, and cried\\r\\nin English, â\\x80\\x9cO Jesus!â\\x80\\x94sure it canâ\\x80\\x99t! No â\\x80\\x99tis impossible!â\\x80\\x9d I smiled at\\r\\nhis interjections, saying, â\\x80\\x9cI suppose you are too much of a gentleman\\r\\nto own your friend in adversity.â\\x80\\x9d When he heard me pronounce these\\r\\nwords in our own language, he leaped upon me in a transport of joy,\\r\\nhung about my neck, kissed me from ear to ear, and blubbered like a\\r\\ngreat schoolboy who had been whipped. Then, observing my dress, he set\\r\\nup his throat, crying, â\\x80\\x9cO Lord! O Lord! that ever I should live to see\\r\\nmy dearest friend reduced to the condition of a foot soldier in the\\r\\nFrench service! Why did you consent to my leaving you?â\\x80\\x94but I know the\\r\\nreasonâ\\x80\\x94you thought you had got more creditable friends, and grew\\r\\nashamed of my acquaintance. Ah! Lord help us! though I was a little\\r\\nshort-sighted, I was not altogether blind: and though I did not\\r\\ncomplain, I was not the less sensible of your unkindness, which was\\r\\nindeed the only thing that induced me to ramble abroad, the Lord knows\\r\\nwhither; but I must own it has been a lucky ramble for me, and so I\\r\\nforgive you, and may God forgive you! O Lord! Lord! is it come to\\r\\nthis?â\\x80\\x9d I was nettled at the charge, which, though just, I could not\\r\\nhelp thinking unseasonable, and told him with some tartness that,\\r\\nwhether his suspicions were well or ill grounded, he might have chosen\\r\\na more convenient opportunity of introducing them; and that the\\r\\nquestion now was whether or no he found himself disposed to lend me any\\r\\nassistance. â\\x80\\x9cDisposed!â\\x80\\x9d replied he with great emotion; â\\x80\\x9cI thought you\\r\\nhad known me so well as to assure yourself without asking, that I, and\\r\\nall that belongs to me, are at your command. In the meantime you shall\\r\\ndine with me, and I will tell you something that, perhaps, will not be\\r\\ndispleasing unto you.â\\x80\\x9d Then, wringing my hand, he said, â\\x80\\x9cIt makes my\\r\\nheart bleed to see you in that garb!â\\x80\\x9d I thanked him for his invitation,\\r\\nwhich, I observed, could not be unwelcome to a person who had not eaten\\r\\na comfortable meal these seven months; but I had another request to\\r\\nmake, which I begged he would grant before dinner, and that was the\\r\\nloan of a shirt; for although my back had been many weeks a stranger to\\r\\nany comfort of that kind, my skin was not yet familiarised to the want\\r\\nof it. He stared in my face, with a woful countenance, at this\\r\\ndeclaration, which he could scarce believe, until I explained it by\\r\\nunbuttoning my coat and disclosing my naked bodyâ\\x80\\x94a circumstance which\\r\\nshocked the tender-hearted Strap, who, with tears in his eyes, ran to a\\r\\nchest of drawers, and taking out some linen, presented to me a very\\r\\nfine ruffled Holland shirt and cambric neckcloth, assuring me he had\\r\\nthree dozen of the same kind at my service.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was ravished at this piece of good news and, having accommodated\\r\\nmyself in a moment, hugged my benefactor for his generous offer,\\r\\nsaying, I was overjoyed to find him undebauched by prosperity, which\\r\\nseldom fails to corrupt the heart. He bespoke for dinner some soup and\\r\\nbouilli, a couple of pullets roasted, and a dish of asparagus, and in\\r\\nthe interim entertained me with biscuit and Burgundy, after which\\r\\nrepast he entreated me to gratify his longing desire of knowing every\\r\\ncircumstance of my fortune since his departure from London. This\\r\\nrequest I complied with, beginning at the adventure of Gawky, and\\r\\nrelating every particular event in which I had been concerned from that\\r\\nday to the present hour. During the recital, my friend was strongly\\r\\naffected, according to the various situations described. He stared with\\r\\nsurprise, glowed with indignation, gaped with curiosity, smiled with\\r\\npleasure, trembled with fear, and wept with sorrow, as the vicissitudes\\r\\nof my life inspired these different passions; and, when my story was\\r\\nended, signified his amazement on the whole, by lifting up his eyes and\\r\\nhands and protesting that, though I was a young man, had suffered more\\r\\nthan all the blessed martyrs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner, I desired in my turn to know the particulars of his\\r\\nperegrination, and he satisfied me in a few words, by giving me to\\r\\nunderstand that he had lived a year at Paris with his master, who, in\\r\\nthat time having acquired the language, as well as the fashionable\\r\\nexercises to perfection, made a tour of France and Holland, during\\r\\nwhich excursion he was so unfortunate as to meet with three of his own\\r\\ncountrymen on their travels, in whose company he committed such\\r\\nexcesses, that his constitution failed, and he fell into a consumption;\\r\\nthat by the advice of physicians, he went to Montpelier for the benefit\\r\\nof good air, and recovered so well in six weeks, that he returned to\\r\\nRheims seemingly in good health, where he had not continued above a\\r\\nmonth, when he was seized with a looseness that carried him off in ten\\r\\ndays, to the unspeakable sorrow of all who knew him and especially of\\r\\nStrap, who had been very happy in his service, and given such\\r\\nsatisfaction, that his master, on his death-bed recommended him to\\r\\nseveral persons of distinction for his diligence, sobriety, and\\r\\naffection, and left him by will his wearing apparel, gold watch, sword,\\r\\nrings, ready money, and all the moveables he had in France, to the\\r\\nvalue of three hundred pounds â\\x80\\x9cwhich I now,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cin the sight of\\r\\nGod and man, surrender to your absolute disposal: here are my keys;\\r\\ntake them, I beseech you, and God give you joy of the possession.â\\x80\\x9d My\\r\\nbrain was almost turned by this sudden change of fortune, which I could\\r\\nscarce believe real: however, I positively refused this extravagant\\r\\nproffer of my friend, and put him in mind of my being a soldier; at\\r\\nwhich hint he started, crying, â\\x80\\x9cOdso! thatâ\\x80\\x99s true! we must procure your\\r\\ndischarge. I have some interest with a nobleman who is able to do me\\r\\nthat favour.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWe consulted about this affair, and it was determined that Monsieur\\r\\ndâ\\x80\\x99Estrapes should wait upon the Marquis in the morning, and tell him he\\r\\nhad by accident found his brother, whom he had not seen for many years\\r\\nbefore, a private soldier in the regiment of Picardy, and implore that\\r\\nnoblemanâ\\x80\\x99s interest for his discharge. In the meantime, we enjoyed\\r\\nourselves over a bottle of good Burgundy, and spent the evening in\\r\\nconcerting schemes for our future conduct, in case I should be so lucky\\r\\nas to get rid of the army. The business was to make ourselves easy for\\r\\nlife by means of his legacy, a task very difficult, and, in the usual\\r\\nmethods of laying out money, altogether impracticable, so that, after\\r\\nmuch canvassing, we could come to no resolution that night, but when we\\r\\nparted, recommended the matter to the serious attention of each other.\\r\\nAs for my own part, I puzzled my imagination to no purpose. When I\\r\\nthought of turning merchant, the smallness of our stock, and the risk\\r\\nof seas, enemies, and markets, deterred me from that scheme. If I\\r\\nshould settle as a surgeon in my own country, I would find the business\\r\\nalready overstocked; or, if I pretended to set up in England, must\\r\\nlabour under want of friends and powerful opposition, obstacles\\r\\ninsurmountable by the most shining merit: neither should I succeed in\\r\\nmy endeavours to rise in the state, inasmuch as I could neither flatter\\r\\nnor pimp for courtiers, nor prostitute my pen in defence of a wicked\\r\\nand contemptible administration. Before I could form any feasible\\r\\nproject, I fell asleep, and my fancy was blest with the image of the\\r\\ndear Narcissa, who seemed to smile upon my passion, and offer her hand\\r\\nas a reward for all my toils.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning, I went to the lodgings of my friend, whom I found\\r\\nexulting over his happy invention! for I no sooner entered his\\r\\napartment, than he addressed himself to me in these words, with a smile\\r\\nof self-applause: â\\x80\\x9cWell, Mr. Random, a lucky thought may come into a\\r\\nfoolâ\\x80\\x99s head sometimes. I have hit itâ\\x80\\x94Iâ\\x80\\x99ll hold you a button my plan is\\r\\nbetter than yours, for all your learning. But you shall have the\\r\\npreference in this as in all other things; therefore proceed, and let\\r\\nus know the effects of your meditation; and then I will impart my own\\r\\nsimple excogitations.â\\x80\\x9d I told him, that not one thought had occurred to\\r\\nme which deserved the least notice, and signified my impatience to be\\r\\nacquainted with the fruits of his reflection. â\\x80\\x9cAs we have not,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nhe, â\\x80\\x9cmoney sufficient to maintain us during a tedious expectation, it\\r\\nis my opinion that a bold push must be made; and I see none so likely\\r\\nto succeed as your appearing in the character of a gentleman (which is\\r\\nyour due), and making your addresses to some lady of fortune, who can\\r\\nrender you independent at once. Nay, donâ\\x80\\x99t stareâ\\x80\\x94I affirm that this\\r\\nscheme is both prudent and honourable; for I would not have you throw\\r\\nyourself away upon an old toothless wheezing dame, whose breath would\\r\\nstink you into a consumption in less than three months, neither would I\\r\\nadvise you to assume the character of a wealthy squire, as your common\\r\\nfortune-hunters do, by which means many a poor lady is cheated into\\r\\nmatrimony, and instead of enjoying the pomp and grandeur that was\\r\\npromised, sees her dowry seized by her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s rapacious creditors,\\r\\nand herself reduced to misery and despair. No, I know you have a soul\\r\\nthat disdains such imposition; and are master of qualifications, both\\r\\nof mind and body, which alone entitle you to a match that will set you\\r\\nabove the world. I have clothes in my possession that a duke need not\\r\\nbe ashamed to wear. I believe they will fit you as they are, if not\\r\\nthere are plenty of tailors in France. Let us take a short trip to\\r\\nParis, and provide ourselves with all other necessaries, then set out\\r\\nfor England, where I intend to do myself the honour of attending you in\\r\\nquality of a valet. This expedient will save you the expense of a\\r\\nservant, shaving, and dressing; and I doubt not but, by the blessing of\\r\\nGod, we shall bring matters to a speedy and fortunate issue.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nExtravagant as this proposal was, I listened to it with pleasure,\\r\\nbecause it flattered my vanity, and indulged a ridiculous hope I began\\r\\nto entertain of inspiring Narcissa with a mutual flame.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter breakfast, Monsieur dâ\\x80\\x99Estrapes went to pay his devoirs to the\\r\\nmarquis, and was so successful in his application, that I obtained a\\r\\ndischarge in a few days, upon which we set out for Paris. Here I had\\r\\ntime to reflect and congratulate myself upon this sudden transition of\\r\\nfate, which to bear with moderation required some degree of philosophy\\r\\nand self-denial. This truth will be more obvious, if I give a detail of\\r\\nthe particulars, to the quiet possession of which I was raised in an\\r\\ninstant, from the most abject misery and contempt. My wardrobe\\r\\nconsisted of five fashionable coats full mounted, two of which were\\r\\nplain, one of cut velvet, one trimmed with gold, and another with\\r\\nsilver lace, two frocks, one of white drab, with large plate buttons,\\r\\nthe other of blue with gold binding; one waistcoat of gold brocade; one\\r\\nof blue satin, embroidered with silver; one of green silk, trimmed with\\r\\nfigured broad gold lace; one of black silk, with fringes; one of white\\r\\nsatin, one of black cloth, and one of scarlet; six pair of cloth\\r\\nbreeches; one pair of crimson, and another of black velvet; twelve pair\\r\\nof white silk stockings, as many of black silk, and the same number of\\r\\nwhite cotton; one hat, laced with gold point dâ\\x80\\x99Espagne, another with\\r\\nsilver lace scolloped, a third with gold binding, and a fourth plain;\\r\\nthree dozen of fine ruffled shirts, as many neckcloths; one dozen of\\r\\ncambric handkerchiefs, and the like number of silk. The other\\r\\nmoveables, which I possessed by the generosity and friendship of Strap,\\r\\nwere a gold watch with a chased case, two valuable diamond rings, two\\r\\nmourning swords, one with a silver handle, and a fourth cut steel\\r\\ninlaid with gold, a diamond stock buckle, and a set of stone buckles\\r\\nfor the knees and shoes; a pair of silver-mounted pistols with rich\\r\\nhousings; a gold-headed cane, and a snuff-box of tortoiseshell, mounted\\r\\nwith gold, having the picture of a lady in the top. The gentleman left\\r\\nmany other things of value, which my friend had converted into cash\\r\\nbefore I met with him; so that, over and above these particulars, our\\r\\nstock in ready money amounted to something more than two hundred\\r\\npounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus equipped, I put on the gentleman of figure, and, attended by my\\r\\nhonest friend, who was contented with the station of my valet, visited\\r\\nthe Louvre, examined the gallery of Luxembourg, and appeared at\\r\\nVersailles, where I had the honour of seeing his Most Christian Majesty\\r\\neat a considerable quantity of olives. During the month I spent at\\r\\nParis, I went several times to court, the Italian comedy, opera, and\\r\\nplayhouse, danced at a masquerade, and, in short, saw everything\\r\\nremarkable in and about that capital. Then we set out for England by\\r\\nthe way of Flanders, passed through Brussels, Ghent, and Bruges, and\\r\\ntook shipping at Ostend, from whence, in fourteen hours, we arrived at\\r\\nDeal, hired a postchaise, and in twelve hours more got safe to London,\\r\\nhaving disposed of our heavy baggage in the waggon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI inquire for my Uncle, and understand he is gone to seaâ\\x80\\x94take Lodgings\\r\\nat Charing Crossâ\\x80\\x94go to the Play, where I meet with an adventureâ\\x80\\x94Dine at\\r\\nan ordinaryâ\\x80\\x94the Guests describedâ\\x80\\x94become acquainted with Medlar and\\r\\nDoctor Wagtail\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as we alighted at the inn, I dispatched Strap to inquire for my\\r\\nuncle at the Union Flag in Wapping; and he returned in a little time,\\r\\nwith an account of Mr. Bowlingâ\\x80\\x99s having gone to sea, mate of a merchant\\r\\nship, after a long and unsuccessful application attendance at the\\r\\nAdmiralty; where, it seems, the interest he depended upon was not\\r\\nsufficient to reinstate him, or recover the pay that was due to him\\r\\nwhen he quitted the Thunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day I hired very handsome lodgings not far from Charing Cross; and\\r\\nin the evening dressed myself in a plain suit of the true Paris cut,\\r\\nand appeared in a front box at the play, where I saw a good deal of\\r\\ncompany, and was vain enough to believe that I was observed with an\\r\\nuncommon degree of attention and applause. This silly conceit\\r\\nintoxicated me so much, that I was guilty of a thousand ridiculous\\r\\ncoquetries; and I dare say, how favourable soever the thoughts of the\\r\\ncompany might be at my first appearance, they were soon changed by my\\r\\nabsurd behaviour into pity or contempt. I rose and sat down, covered\\r\\nand uncovered my head twenty times between the acts; pulled out my\\r\\nwatch, clapped it to my ear, wound it up, set it, gave it the hearing\\r\\nagain; displayed my snuff-box, affected to take snuff, that I might\\r\\nhave all opportunity of showing my brilliant, and wiped my nose with\\r\\nperfumed handkerchief; then dangled my cane, and adjusted my\\r\\nsword-knot, and acted many more fooleries of the same kind, in hopes of\\r\\nobtaining the character of a pretty fellow, in the acquiring of which I\\r\\nfound two considerable obstructions in my dispositionâ\\x80\\x94namely, a natural\\r\\nreserve and jealous sensibility. Fain would I have entered into\\r\\nconversation with the people around me: but I was restrained by the\\r\\nfear of being censured for my assurance, as well as by reflecting that\\r\\nI was more entitled to a compliment of this kind from them, than they\\r\\nto such condescension from a stranger like me. How often did I redden\\r\\nat the frequent whispers and loud laughter of my fellow beaux, which I\\r\\nimagined were excited by me; and how often did I envy the happy\\r\\nindifference of those choice spirits, who behold the distress of the\\r\\nscene without discovering the least symptom of approbation or concern.\\r\\nMy attention was engaged in spite of myself, and I could not help\\r\\nweeping with the heroine of the stage, though I practised a great many\\r\\nshifs to conceal this piece of unpolite weakness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the play was ended, I sat waiting for an opportunity of handing\\r\\nsome lady to her coach; but everyone was attended by such a number of\\r\\nofficious gallants, that for a long time I was balked in my\\r\\nexpectation. At length, however, I perceived a very handsome creature,\\r\\ngenteelly dressed, sitting by herself in a box, at some distance from\\r\\nme; upon which I went up to her, and offered my service. She seemed to\\r\\nbe in some confusion, thanked me for my complaisance, and with a tender\\r\\nlook declined giving me the trouble: looking at her watch, and\\r\\ntestifying her surprise at the negligence of her footman whom she had\\r\\nordered to have a chair ready for her at that hour. I repeated my\\r\\nentreaty with all the eloquence and compliment I was master of; and, in\\r\\nthe event, she was prevailed upon to accept of a proposal I made, to\\r\\nsend my servant for a chair or coach: accordingly, Strap was detached\\r\\nfor that purpose, and returned without success. By this time the\\r\\nplayhouse was quite empty, and we were obliged to retire. As I led her\\r\\nthrough the passage, I observed five or six young fellows of fashion\\r\\nstanding in a corner, one of whom, as I thought, tipped my charmer the\\r\\nwink, and when we were passed, I heard a loud laugh. This note aroused\\r\\nmy attention, and I was resolved to be fully satisfied of this ladyâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncharacter, before I should have any nearer connection with her. As no\\r\\nconvenience appeared, I proposed to conduct her to a tavern, where we\\r\\nmight stay a few minutes, until my servant could fetch a coach from the\\r\\nStrand. She seemed particularly shy of trusting herself in a tavern\\r\\nwith a stranger, but at last yielded to my pathetic remonstrances,\\r\\nrather than endanger her health by remaining in a cold, damp\\r\\nthoroughfare. Having thus far succeeded, I begged to know what wine she\\r\\nwould be pleased to drink a glass of; but she professed the greatest\\r\\naversion to all sorts of strong liquors, and it was with much\\r\\ndifficulty that I could persuade her to eat a jelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, I endeavoured to alleviate the uneasiness she\\r\\ndiscovered, by saying all the agreeable things I could think of; at\\r\\nwhich she would often sigh, and regard me with a languishing look, that\\r\\nseemed, however, too near akin to the lewd leer of a courtesan. This\\r\\ndiscovery added to my former suspicion, while it put me upon my guard\\r\\nagainst her arts, divested me of reserve, and enabled me to entertain\\r\\nher with gaiety and freedom. In the course of our conversation, I\\r\\npressed her to allow me the honour of waiting upon her next day at her\\r\\nlodgings, a request which she, with many apologues, refused, lest it\\r\\nshould give umbrage to Sir John, who was of a disposition apt to be\\r\\nfretted with trifles. This information, by which I was to understand\\r\\nthat her husband was a knight, did not check my addresses, which became\\r\\nmore and more importunate, and I was even hardy enough to ravish a\\r\\nkiss. But, O heavens! instead of banqueting on the ambrosial flavour,\\r\\nthat her delicacy of complexion promised, I was almost suffocated with\\r\\nthe steams of Geneva! An exhalation of this kind, from a mouth which\\r\\nhad just before declared an utter abhorrence of all spirituous liquors,\\r\\nnot only changed my doubts into certainty, but my raptures into\\r\\nloathing; and it would have been impossible for me to have preserved\\r\\ncommon complaisance five minutes longer, when my servant returned with\\r\\na coach. I took the advantage of this occasion, and presented my hand\\r\\nto the lady, who put in practice against me the whole artillery of her\\r\\ncharms, ogling, languishing, sighing, and squeezing, with so little\\r\\nreserve that Strap perceived her tenderness, and rubbed his hands with\\r\\njoy as he followed us to the door; but I was proof against all her\\r\\nendearments, and handed her into the coach with an intention to take my\\r\\nleave immediately. She guessed my design, and invited me to her house,\\r\\nwhispering, that now Sir John was gone to bed, she could have the\\r\\npleasure of my conversation for half-an-hour without interruption. I\\r\\ntold her there was no mortification I would not undergo, rather than\\r\\nendanger the repose of her ladyship; and, bidding the coachman drive\\r\\non, wished her a good night. She lost all temper at my indifference,\\r\\nand, stopping the coach, at the distance of about twenty yards from me,\\r\\npopped out her head, and howled with the lungs of a fishwoman, â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n\\r\\nyou, you dog, wonâ\\x80\\x99t you pay the coach-hire?â\\x80\\x9d As I made no answer, she\\r\\nheld forth against me with an eloquence peculiar to herself; calling me\\r\\npitifull fellow, scoundrel, and a hundred such appellations; concluding\\r\\nwith an oath, that, for all my appearance, she believed I had got no\\r\\nmoney in my pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving thus vented her indignation, she ordered her coachman to\\r\\nproceed, and I returned to the tavern, where I bespoke something for\\r\\nsupper, very well pleased at the issue of this adventure. I dispensed\\r\\nwith the attendance of the waiter at table, on pretence that my own\\r\\nservant was present, and, when we were alone, said to Strap, â\\x80\\x9cWell,\\r\\nMonsieur dâ\\x80\\x99Estrapes, what dâ\\x80\\x99ye think of this lady?â\\x80\\x9d My friend, who had\\r\\nnot opened his mouth since her departure, could make no other reply\\r\\nthan the monosyllable â\\x80\\x9cThink!â\\x80\\x9d which he pronounced with a note of fear\\r\\nand astonishment. Surprised at this emphasis, I surveyed my valet, and,\\r\\nperceiving a wildness in his looks, asked if he had seen his\\r\\ngrandfatherâ\\x80\\x99s ghost? â\\x80\\x9cGhost!â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI am sure I have seen a devil\\r\\nincarnate! Who would have thought that so much devilish malice and\\r\\nBillingsgate could lurk under so much sweetness of countenance and\\r\\nmodesty of behaviour? Ah! God help us! Fronti nulla fidesâ\\x80\\x94nimium ne\\r\\ncrede coloriâ\\x80\\x94but we ought to down on our knees, and bless God for\\r\\ndelivering us from the jaws of that painted sepulchre!â\\x80\\x9d I was pretty\\r\\nmuch of Strapâ\\x80\\x99s opinion, and, though I did not believe myself in any\\r\\ndanger from the allurements of that sisterhood, I determined to act\\r\\nwith great circumspection for the future, and shun all commerce of that\\r\\nkind, as equally prejudicial to my purse and constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy next care was to introduce myself into a set of good acquaintance:\\r\\nfor which purpose I frequented a certain coffee-house, noted for the\\r\\nresort of good company, English as well as foreigners, where my\\r\\nappearance procured all the civilities and advances I could desire. As\\r\\nthere was an ordinary in the same house, I went upstairs to dinner with\\r\\nthe other guests, and found myself at a table with thirteen people, the\\r\\ngreatest part of whom were better dressed than myself. The\\r\\nconversation, which was mostly carried on in French, turned chiefly on\\r\\npolitics; and I soon found the whole company were in the French\\r\\ninterest, myself excepted, and a testy old gentleman, who contradicted\\r\\neverything that was advanced in favour of his Most Christian Majesty,\\r\\nwith a surliness truly English. But this trusty patriot, who had never\\r\\nbeen out of his own country, and drew all his maxims and notions from\\r\\nprejudice and hearsay, was very unequal to his antagonists, who were\\r\\nsuperior to him in learning and experience, and often took the liberty\\r\\nof travellers in asserting things which were not strictly true, because\\r\\nthey thought themselves in no danger of being detected by him. The\\r\\nclaim of the Queen Of Spain to the Austrian dominions in Italy was\\r\\nfully explained and vindicated, by a person who sat opposite to me,\\r\\nand, by the solemnity of his manner and the richness of his apparel,\\r\\nseemed to be a foreign ambassador. This dissertation produced another\\r\\non the Pragmatic Sanction, handled with great warmth by a young\\r\\ngentleman at my right hand, dressed in a green frock, trimmed with\\r\\ngold, who justified the French king for his breach of that contract;\\r\\nand affirmed that he could not have observed it without injuring his\\r\\nown glory. Although I was not at all convinced by this gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\narguments, I could not help admiring his vivacity which, I imagined,\\r\\nmust be the effect of his illustrious birth and noble education, and\\r\\naccordingly rated him, in my conjecture, as a young prince on his\\r\\ntravels. The discourse was afterwards shifted by an old gentleman, of a\\r\\nvery martial appearance, to the last campaign, when the battle of\\r\\nDettingen was fought over again, with so many circumstances to the\\r\\nhonour of the French and disadvantages if the Allies, that I began to\\r\\nentertain some doubts of my having been there in person, and took the\\r\\nliberty to mention some objections to what he advanced. This freedom\\r\\nintroduced a dispute, which lasted a good while, to the mortification\\r\\nof all present; and was at last referred to the determination of a\\r\\ngrave person, whom they styled Doctor, and who, under a show of great\\r\\nmoderation, decided it against me, with so little regard to truth, that\\r\\nI taxed him with partiality in pretty severe terms, to the no small\\r\\nentertainment of the true English politician, who rejoiced at my\\r\\ndefence of a cause he had so often espoused without success.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy opponent, pleased with the victory he had gained, affected a great\\r\\ndeal of candour, and told me, he should not have been so positive, if\\r\\nhe had not been at great pains to inform himself of each particular.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIndeed,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI am convinced that the previous steps considered,\\r\\nthings could not happen otherwise; for we generals who have seen\\r\\nservice, though we may not be on the spot ourselves, know by the least\\r\\nsketch of the disposition what must be the event.â\\x80\\x9d He then censured,\\r\\nwith great freedom, every circumstance of the conduct of those who\\r\\ncommanded the Allies; from thence made a transition to the ministry,\\r\\nwhich he honoured with many invectives for employing people who had\\r\\nneither experience nor capacity, to the prejudice of old officers, who\\r\\nhad been distinguished for both; dropped many hints of his own\\r\\nimportance, and concluded with observing, that the French and Spaniards\\r\\nknew better how to value generals of merit; the good effects of which\\r\\nare seen in the conquests they gain, and the discipline of their\\r\\ntroops, which are at the same time better clothed and paid than any\\r\\nsoldiers in the universe. These remarks furnished the green knight with\\r\\nan opportunity of launching out in the praise of the French government\\r\\nin general, civil as well as military; on which occasion he made many\\r\\nodious comparisons to the disadvantage of the English. Everybody,\\r\\nalmost, assented to the observations he made, and the doctor gave his\\r\\nsanction, by saying, the people of France were undoubtedly the happiest\\r\\nsubjects in the world. I was so much astonished and confounded at their\\r\\ninfatuation and effrontery, that I had not power to utter one word in\\r\\nopposition to their assertions; but my morose associate could not put\\r\\nup with the indignity that was offered to Old England, and therefore\\r\\nwith a satirical grin addressed himself to the general in these words:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir, sir, I have often heard it said, Sheâ\\x80\\x99s a villainous bird that\\r\\nbefouls her own nest. As for what those people who are foreigners say,\\r\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t mind it; they know no better; but you who were bred and born,\\r\\nand have got your bread, under the English government, should have more\\r\\nregard to gratitude, as well as truth in censuring your native country.\\r\\nIf the ministry have thought fit to lay you aside, I suppose they have\\r\\ntheir own reasons for so doing; and you ought to remember, that you\\r\\nstill live on the bounty of this nation. As for these gentlemen\\r\\n(meaning the prince and ambassador), who make so free with our\\r\\nconstitution, laws, and genius of our people, I think they might show a\\r\\nlittle more respect for their benefactors, who, I must own, are to\\r\\nblame in harbouring and protecting, and encouraging such ungrateful\\r\\nvagrants as they are.â\\x80\\x9d At these words, the chevalier in green started\\r\\nup in a great passion, and laying his hand on the hilt of his hanger,\\r\\nexclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cAh! foutre!â\\x80\\x9d The Englishman on the other hand, grasping his\\r\\ncane cried, â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t foutre me, sirrah, or by Gâ\\x80\\x94d Iâ\\x80\\x99ll knock you down.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThe company interposed, the Frenchman sat down again, and his\\r\\nantagonist proceededâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cLookey, Monsieur, you know very well that had you\\r\\ndared to speak so freely of the administration of your own country in\\r\\nParis as you have done of ours in London, you would have been sent to\\r\\nthe Bastille without ceremony, where you might have rotted in a\\r\\ndungeon, and never seen the light of the sun again. Now, sir, take my\\r\\nword for it, although our constitution screens us from such oppression,\\r\\nwe want not laws to chastise the authors of seditious discourse, and if\\r\\nI hear another syllable out of your mouth in contempt or prejudice of\\r\\nthis kingdom, I will give you a convincing proof of what I advance, and\\r\\nhave you laid by the heels for your presumption.â\\x80\\x9d This declaration had\\r\\nan effect on the company as sudden as surprising. The young prince\\r\\nbecame as supple as a spaniel, the ambassador trembled, the general sat\\r\\nsilent and abashed, and the doctor, who it seems, had felt the rod of\\r\\npower, grew pale as death, and assured us all, that he had no intention\\r\\nto affront any person or people. â\\x80\\x9cYour principles, doctor,â\\x80\\x9d resumed the\\r\\nold gentleman, â\\x80\\x9care no secretâ\\x80\\x94I have nothing to say upon that head; but\\r\\nam very much surprised, that a man who despises us so much, should\\r\\nnotwithstanding live among us, when he has no visible motive for so\\r\\ndoing. Why donâ\\x80\\x99t you take up your habitation in your beloved France,\\r\\nwhere you may rail at England without censure?â\\x80\\x9d To this remonstrance\\r\\nthe doctor thought proper to make no reply, and an unsocial silence\\r\\nensued; which I perceiving, took notice, that it was pity such idle\\r\\ndisputes, maintained very often through whim or diversion, should\\r\\ncreate any misunderstanding among gentlemen of good sense, and proposed\\r\\nto drink down all animosity in another bottle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis motion was applauded by the whole company. The wine was brought,\\r\\nand the English champion, declaring he had no spleen against any man\\r\\nfor differing in opinion from him, any more than for difference of\\r\\ncomplexion, drank to the good health of all present; the compliment was\\r\\nreturned, and the conversation once more became unreserved though more\\r\\ngeneral than before. Among other topics, the subject of war was\\r\\nintroduced, on which the general declaimed with great eloquence,\\r\\nrecounting many of his own exploits by way of illustration. In the\\r\\ncourse of his harangue he happened to mention the word epaulement, upon\\r\\nwhich the testy gentleman asked the meaning, of that term. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell\\r\\nyou what an epaulement is,â\\x80\\x9d replied he, â\\x80\\x9cI never saw an epaulement but\\r\\nonce, and that was at the siege of Namur. In a council of war, Monsieur\\r\\nCohorn, the famous engineer, affirmed that the place could not be\\r\\ntaken.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said the Prince of Vandemont, â\\x80\\x9cit may be taken by an\\r\\nepaulement.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThis was immediately put into execution, and in\\r\\ntwenty-four hours Mareschal Boufflers was fain to capitulate.â\\x80\\x9d Here he\\r\\nmade a full stop, and the old gentleman repeated the question, â\\x80\\x9cBut\\r\\npray what is an epaulement?â\\x80\\x9d To this interrogation the officer made no\\r\\nimmediate reply, but rang the bell, and called for the bill, which\\r\\nbeing brought, he threw down his proportion of the reckoning, and,\\r\\ntelling the company he would show them an epaulement when his majesty\\r\\nshould think fit to entrust him with the command of our army abroad,\\r\\nstrutted away with great dignity. I could not imagine why he was so shy\\r\\nof explaining one of the most simple terms of fortification, which I\\r\\nforthwith described as a side-work composed of earth, gabions, or\\r\\nfascines; but I was very much surprised when I afterwards understood\\r\\nthat his reserve proceeded from his ignorance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving paid our bill, we adjourned to the coffee-room, where my\\r\\nfellow-labourer insisted on treating me with a dish, giving me to\\r\\nunderstand, at the same time, that I had acquired his good opinion,\\r\\nboth with respect to my principles and understanding. I thanked him for\\r\\nhis compliment, and, professing myself an utter stranger in this part\\r\\nof the world, begged he would have the goodness to inform me of the\\r\\nquality and characters of the people who dined above. This request was\\r\\na real favour to one of his disposition, which was no less\\r\\ncommunicative than curious; he therefore complied with great\\r\\nsatisfaction, and told me, to my extreme astonishment, that the\\r\\nsupposed young prince was a dancer at one of the theatres, and the\\r\\nambassador no other than a fiddler belonging to the opera. â\\x80\\x9cThe\\r\\ndoctor,â\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cis a Roman Catholic priest, who sometimes appears in\\r\\nthe character of an officer, and assumes the name of captain; but more\\r\\ngenerally takes the garb, title, and behaviour of a physician, in which\\r\\ncapacity he wheedles himself into the confidence of weak-minded people,\\r\\nand by arguments no less specious than false, converts them from their\\r\\nreligion and allegiance. He has been in the hands of justice more than\\r\\nonce for such practices, but he is a sly dog, and manages matters with\\r\\nso much craft, that hitherto he has escaped for a short imprisonment.\\r\\nAs for the general, you may see he has owed his promotion more to his\\r\\ninterest than his capacity; and, now that the eyes of the ministry are\\r\\nopened, his friends dead or become inconsiderable, he is struck off the\\r\\nlist, and obliged to put up with a yearly pension. In consequence of\\r\\nthis reduction, he is become malcontent, and inveighs against the\\r\\ngovernment in all companies, with so little discretion, that I am\\r\\nsurprised at the lenity of the administration, in overlooking his\\r\\ninsolence, but the truth of the matter is, he owes his safety to his\\r\\nweakness and want of importance. He has seen a little, and but a\\r\\nlittle, service, and yet, if you will take his word to it, there has\\r\\nnot been a great action performed in the field since the Revolution, in\\r\\nwhich he was not principally concerned. When a story is told of any\\r\\ngreat general, he immediately matches it with one of himself, though he\\r\\nis often unhappy in his invention, and commits such gross blunders in\\r\\nthe detail, that everybody is in pain for him. Caesar, Pompey, and\\r\\nAlexander the Great, are continually in his mouth; and, as he reads a\\r\\ngood deal without any judgment to digest it, his ideas are confused,\\r\\nand his harangues as unintelligible as infinite; for, if once he begin,\\r\\nthere is no chance of his leaving off speaking while one person remains\\r\\nto yield attention; therefore the only expedient I know, for putting a\\r\\nstop to his loquacity, is to lay hold of some incongruity he has\\r\\nuttered, and demand an explanation; or ask the meaning of some\\r\\ndifficult term that he knows by name; this method will effectually put\\r\\nhim to silence, if not to flight, as it happened when I inquired about\\r\\nan epaulement. Had he been acquainted with the signification of that\\r\\nword, his triumph would have been intolerable, and we must have quitted\\r\\nthe field first, or been worried with impertinence.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving thus gratified my curiosity, the old gentleman began to discover\\r\\nhis own, in questions relating to myself, to which I thought proper to\\r\\nreturn ambiguous answers. â\\x80\\x9cI presume, Sir,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cyou have\\r\\ntravelled.â\\x80\\x9d I answered, â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI dare say you have found it very\\r\\nexpensive,â\\x80\\x9d said he. I replied, â\\x80\\x9cTo be sure, one cannot travel without\\r\\nmoney.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThat I know by experience,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cfor I myself take a trip\\r\\nto Bath or Tunbridge every season; and one must pay sauce for what he\\r\\nhas on the road, as well in other countries as in this. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s a pretty\\r\\nstone in your ringâ\\x80\\x94give me leave, sirâ\\x80\\x94the French have attained to a\\r\\nwonderful skill in making compositions of this kind. Why, now, this\\r\\nlooks almost as well as a diamond.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAlmost as well, Sir!â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cWhy\\r\\nnot altogether? I am sure if you understand anything of jewels, you\\r\\nmust perceive, at first sight, that this stone is a real diamond, and\\r\\nthat of a very fine water. Take it in your hand and examine it.â\\x80\\x9d He did\\r\\nso with some confusion, and returned it, saying, â\\x80\\x9cI ask your pardon; I\\r\\nsee it is a true brilliant of immense value.â\\x80\\x9d I imagined his respect to\\r\\nme increased after this inquiry; therefore to captivate his esteem the\\r\\nmore, I told him, I would show him a seal of composition, engraved\\r\\nafter a very valuable antique; upon which I pulled out my watch with a\\r\\nrich gold chain, adorned with three seals set in gold, and an opal\\r\\nring. He viewed each of them with great eagerness, handled the chain,\\r\\nadmired the chased case, and observed that the whole must have cost me\\r\\na vast sum of money. I affected indifference, and replied in a careless\\r\\nmanner, â\\x80\\x9cSome trifle of sixty or seventy guineas.â\\x80\\x9d He stared in my face\\r\\nfor some time, and then asked if I was an Englishman? I answered in the\\r\\nnegative. â\\x80\\x9cYou are from Ireland then, Sir, I presume,â\\x80\\x9d said he. I made\\r\\nthe same reply. â\\x80\\x9cOh! perhaps,â\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cyou were born in one of our\\r\\nsettlements abroad.â\\x80\\x9d I still answered No. He seemed very much\\r\\nsurprised, and said, he was sure I was not a foreigner. I made no\\r\\nreply, but left him upon the tenter-hooks of impatient uncertainty. He\\r\\ncould not contain his anxiety, but asked pardon for the liberties he\\r\\nhad taken and, to encourage me the more to disclose my situation,\\r\\ndisplayed his own without reserve. â\\x80\\x9cI am,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9ca single man, have\\r\\na considerable annuity, on which I live according to my inclination,\\r\\nand make the ends of the year meet very comfortably. As I have no\\r\\nestate to leave behind, I am not troubled with the importunate\\r\\nofficiousness of relations or legacy hunters, and I consider the world\\r\\nas made for me, not me for the world. It is my maxim, therefore, to\\r\\nenjoy it while I can, and let futurity shift for itself.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he thus indulged his own talkative vein, and at the same time, no\\r\\ndoubt, expected retaliation from me, a young man entered, dressed in\\r\\nblack velvet and an enormous tie-wig, with an air in which natural\\r\\nlevity and affected solemnity were so jumbled together, that on the\\r\\nwhole he appeared a burlesque on all decorum. This ridiculous oddity\\r\\ndanced up to the table at which we sat, and, after a thousand grimaces,\\r\\nasked my friend by the name of Mr. Medlar, if we were not engaged upon\\r\\nbusiness. My companion put on a surly countenance, and replied â\\x80\\x9cNo\\r\\ngreat business, doctorâ\\x80\\x94but howeverâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh! then,â\\x80\\x9d cried the physician;\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must beg your indulgence a little; pray pardon me, gentlemen.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x9d said he, addressing himself to me, â\\x80\\x9cyour most humble servant. I\\r\\nhope you will forgive me, sirâ\\x80\\x94I must beg the favour to sitâ\\x80\\x94sirâ\\x80\\x94sirâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nhave something of consequence to impart to my friend Mr. Medlarâ\\x80\\x94sir, I\\r\\nhope you will excuse my freedom in whispering, sir,â\\x80\\x9d Before I had time\\r\\nto give this complaisant person my permission, Mr. Medlar cried, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nhave no whisperingâ\\x80\\x94if you have anything to say to me, speak with an\\r\\naudible voice.â\\x80\\x9d The doctor seemed a little disconcerted at this\\r\\nexclamation, and, turning again to me, made a thousand apologies for\\r\\npretending to make a mystery of anything, a piece of caution which he\\r\\nsaid was owing to his ignorance of my connection with Mr. Medlar; but\\r\\nnow he understood I was a friend, and would communicate what he had to\\r\\nsay in my hearing. He then began, after two or three hems, in this\\r\\nmanner: â\\x80\\x9cYou must know, sir, I am just come from dinner at my Lady\\r\\nFlareitâ\\x80\\x99s (then addressing himself to me), a lady of quality, sir, at\\r\\nwhose table I have the honour of dining sometimes. There was Lady\\r\\nStately and my Lady Larum, and Mrs. Dainty, and Miss Biddy Giggler,\\r\\nupon my word, a very good-natured young lady, with a very pretty\\r\\nfortune sir. There was also my Lord Straddle. Sir John Shrug, and\\r\\nMaster Billy Chatter, who is actually a very facetious young gentleman.\\r\\nSo, sir, her ladyship seeing me excessively fatigued, for she was the\\r\\nlast of fifteen patients (people of distinction, sir) whom I had\\r\\nvisited this forenoon, insisted upon my staying dinner, though upon my\\r\\nword I protest I had no appetite; however, in compliance with her\\r\\nladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s request, sir, I sat down, and the conversation turning on\\r\\ndifferent subjects, among other things, Mr Chatter asked very earnestly\\r\\nwhen I saw Mr. Medlar. I told him I had not had the pleasure of seeing\\r\\nyou these nineteen hours and a half; for you may remember, sir, it was\\r\\nnearly about that time; I wonâ\\x80\\x99t be positive as to a minute.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d says\\r\\nhe, â\\x80\\x9cthen I desire you will go to his lodgings immediately after\\r\\ndinner, and see whatâ\\x80\\x99s the matter with him, for he must certainly be\\r\\nvery bad from having eaten last night such a vast quantity of raw\\r\\noysters.â\\x80\\x9d The crusty gentleman, who, from the solemnity of his\\r\\ndelivery, expected something extraordinary, no sooner heard his\\r\\nconclusion, than he started up in a testy humour, crying, â\\x80\\x9cPshaw,\\r\\npshaw! Dâ\\x80\\x94n your oysters!â\\x80\\x9d and walked away, after a short compliment of,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour servant sir,â\\x80\\x9d to me. The doctor got up also, saying, â\\x80\\x9cI vow and\\r\\nprotest, upon my word, I am actually amazed;â\\x80\\x9d and followed Mr. Medlar\\r\\nto the bar, which was hard by, where he was paying for his coffee:\\r\\nthere he whispered so loud that I could overhear, â\\x80\\x9cPray who is this\\r\\ngentleman?â\\x80\\x9d His friend replied hastily, â\\x80\\x9cI might have known that before\\r\\nnow, if it had not been for your impertinent intrusion,â\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94and walked off\\r\\nvery much disappointed. The ceremonious physician returned immediately\\r\\nand sat down by me, asking a thousand pardons for leaving me alone: and\\r\\ngiving me to understand that what he had communicated to Mr. Medlar at\\r\\nthe bar, was an affair of the last importance, that would admit of no\\r\\ndelay. He then called for some coffee, and launched out into the\\r\\nvirtues of that berry, which, he said, in cold phlegmatic\\r\\nconstitutions, like his, dried up the superfluous moisture, and braced\\r\\nthe relaxed nerves. He told me it was utterly unknown to the ancients;\\r\\nand derived its name from an Arabian word, which I might easily\\r\\nperceive by the sound and termination. From this topic he transferred\\r\\nhis disquisitions to the verb drink, which he affirmed was improperly\\r\\napplied to the taking of coffee, inasmuch as people did not drink, but\\r\\nsip or sipple that liquor; that the genuine meaning of drinking is to\\r\\nquench oneâ\\x80\\x99s thirst, or commit a debauch by swallowing wine; that the\\r\\nLatin word, which conveyed the same idea, was bibere or potare, and\\r\\nthat of the Greeks pinein or poteein, though he was apt to believe they\\r\\nwere differently used on different occasions: for exampleâ\\x80\\x94to drink a\\r\\nvast quantity, or, as the vulgar express it, to drink an ocean of\\r\\nliquor, was in Latin potare, and in Greek poteein; and, on the other\\r\\nhand, to use it moderately, was bibere and pinein;â\\x80\\x94that this was only a\\r\\nconjecture of his, which, however, seemed to be supported by the word\\r\\nbibulous, which is particularly applied to the pores of the skin, and\\r\\ncan only drink a very small quantity of the circumambient moisture, by\\r\\nreason of the smallness of their diameters;â\\x80\\x94whereas, from the verb\\r\\npoteein is derived the substantive potamos, which signifies a river, or\\r\\nvast quantity of liquor. I could not help smiling at this learned and\\r\\nimportant investigation; and, to recommend myself the more to my new\\r\\nacquaintance, whose disposition I was by this time well informed of, I\\r\\nobserved that, what he alleged, did not, to the best of my remembrance,\\r\\nappear in the writings of the ancients; for Horace uses the words poto\\r\\nand bibo indifferently for the same purpose, as in the twentieth Ode of\\r\\nhis first Book.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVile potabis modicis sabinum cantharisâ\\x80\\x94\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x94Et prÅ\\x93lo domitam caleno tu bibes uvam.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat I had never heard of the verb _poteein_, but that _potamos,\\r\\npotema_, and _potos_, were derived from _pino, poso, pepoka_, in\\r\\nconsequence of which, the Greek poets never use any other word for\\r\\nfestal drinking. Homer describes Nestor at his cups in these words,\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNestora dâ\\x80\\x99ouk elathen iache _pinonta_ perempes.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Anacreon mentions it on the same occasion always in every page.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Pinonti_ de oinon hedun.\\r\\nOtan _pino_ ton oinon.\\r\\nOplizâ\\x80\\x99 ego de _pino_.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in a thousand other places. The doctor who doubtless intended by\\r\\nhis criticism to give me a high idea of his erudition, was infinitely\\r\\nsurprised to find himself schooled by one of my appearance; and after a\\r\\nconsiderable pause cried, â\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, you are in the right, sirâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nfind I have not considered this affair with my usual accuracy.â\\x80\\x9d Then,\\r\\naccosting me in Latin, which he spoke very well, the conversation was\\r\\nmaintained full two hours, on a variety of subjects, in that language;\\r\\nand indeed he spoke so judiciously, that I was convinced,\\r\\nnotwithstanding his whimsical appearance and attention to trifles, that\\r\\nhe was a man of extensive knowledge, especially in books; he looked\\r\\nupon me, as I afterwards understood from Mr. Medlar, as a prodigy in\\r\\nlearning, and proposed that very night, if I were not engaged, to\\r\\nintroduce me to several young gentlemen of fortune and fashion, with\\r\\nwhom I had an appointment at the Bedford coffee house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWagtail introduces me to a set of fine Gentlemen with whom I spend the\\r\\nEvening at a Tavernâ\\x80\\x94our Conversationâ\\x80\\x94the Characters of my new\\r\\nCompanionsâ\\x80\\x94the Doctor is roastedâ\\x80\\x94our Issue of our Debauch\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI accepted his offer with pleasure, and we went thither in a hackney\\r\\ncoach where I saw a great number of gay figures fluttering about, most\\r\\nof whom spoke to the doctor with great familiarity. Among the rest\\r\\nstood a group of them round the fire whom I immediately knew to be the\\r\\nvery persons who had the night before, by their laughing, alarmed my\\r\\nsuspicion of the lady who had put herself under my protection. They no\\r\\nsooner perceived me enter with Dr. Wagtail (for that was my companionâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nname) than they tittered and whispered one to another, and I was not a\\r\\nlittle surprised to find that they were the gentlemen to whose\\r\\nacquaintance he designed to recommend me; for, when he observed them\\r\\ntogether, he told me who they were, and desired to know by what name he\\r\\nshould introduce me. I satisfied him in that particular, and he\\r\\nadvanced with great gravity, saying, â\\x80\\x9cGentlemen, your most obedient\\r\\nservant:â\\x80\\x94give me leave to introduce my friend Mr. Random to your\\r\\nsociety.â\\x80\\x9d Then, turning to me, â\\x80\\x9cMr. Random, this is Mr. Bragwellâ\\x80\\x94Mr.\\r\\nBanter, sirâ\\x80\\x94Mr. Chatterâ\\x80\\x94my friend Mr. Slyboot, and Mr. Ranter sir.â\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\nsaluted each of then in order, and when I came to take Mr. Slyboot by\\r\\nthe hand, I perceived him thrust his tongue in his cheek, to the no\\r\\nsmall entertainment of the company; but I did not think proper to take\\r\\nany notice of it on this occasion. Mr. Ranter too (who I afterwards\\r\\nlearned was a player) displayed his talents, by mimicking my air,\\r\\nfeatures, and voice, while he returned my compliment: this feat I\\r\\nshould not have been so sensible of, had I not seen him behave in the\\r\\nsame manner to my friend Wagtail, when he made up to them at first. But\\r\\nfor once I let him enjoy the fruits of his dexterity without question\\r\\nor control, resolved however to chastise his insolence at a more\\r\\nconvenient opportunity. Mr. Slyboot, guessing I was a stranger, asked\\r\\nif I had been lately in France? and when I answered in the affirmative,\\r\\ninquired if I had seen the Luxembourg Gallery? I told him I had\\r\\nconsidered it more than once with great attention: upon this a\\r\\nconversion ensued, in which I discovered him to be a painter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we were discoursing upon the particulars of this famous\\r\\nperformance, I overheard Banter ask Dr. Wagtail, where he had picked up\\r\\nthis Mr. Random. To which question the physician answered, â\\x80\\x9cUpon my\\r\\nword, a mighty pretty sort of a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x94a man of fortune, sirâ\\x80\\x94he has\\r\\nmade the grand tour, and seen the best company in Europe, air.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat,\\r\\nhe told you so, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d said the other: â\\x80\\x9cI take him to be neither\\r\\nmore nor less than a French valet-de-chambre.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cO barbarous,\\r\\nbarbarous!â\\x80\\x9d cried the doctor; â\\x80\\x9cthis is actually, upon my word,\\r\\naltogether unaccountable. I know all his family perfectly well, sir; he\\r\\nis of the Randoms of the northâ\\x80\\x94a very ancient house sir, and a distant\\r\\nrelation of mine.â\\x80\\x9d I was extremely nettled at the conjecture of Mr.\\r\\nBanter, and began to entertain a very indifferent opinion of my company\\r\\nin general; but, as I might possibly by their means acquire a more\\r\\nextensive and agreeable acquaintance, I determined to bear these little\\r\\nmortifications as long as I could without injuring the dignity of my\\r\\ncharacter. After having talked for some time on the weather, plays,\\r\\npolitics, and other coffee-house subjects, it was proposed that we\\r\\nshould spend the evening at a noted tavern in the neighbourhood,\\r\\nwhither we repaired in a body.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving taken possession of a room, called for French wine, and bespoke\\r\\nsupper, the glass went about pretty freely, and the characters of my\\r\\nassociates opened upon me more and more. It soon appeared that the\\r\\ndoctor was entertained as butt for the painter and player to exercise\\r\\ntheir wit upon, for the diversion of the company. Mr. Ranter began the\\r\\ngame by asking him what was good for a hoarseness, lowness of spirits,\\r\\nand in digestion, for he was troubled with all these complaints to a\\r\\nvery great degree. Wagtail immediately undertook to explain the nature\\r\\nof his case, and in a very prolix manner harangued upon prognostics,\\r\\ndiagnostics, symptomatics, therapeutics, inanition, and repletion; then\\r\\ncalculated the force of the stomach and lungs in their respective\\r\\noperations; ascribed the playerâ\\x80\\x99s malady to a disorder in these organs,\\r\\nproceeding from hard drinkings and vociferations, and prescribed a\\r\\ncourse of stomachics, with abstinence from venery, wine, loud speaking,\\r\\nlaughing, singing, coughing, sneezing, or hallooing. â\\x80\\x9cPah, pah!â\\x80\\x9d cried\\r\\nRanter, interrupting him, â\\x80\\x9cthe remedy is worse than the diseaseâ\\x80\\x94I wish\\r\\nI knew where to find some tinder water.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTinder water!â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\ndoctor; â\\x80\\x9cUpon my word, I donâ\\x80\\x99t apprehend you, Mr. Ranter.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWater\\r\\nextracted from tinder,â\\x80\\x9d replied the other, â\\x80\\x9ca universal specific for\\r\\nall distempers incident to man. It was invented by a learned German\\r\\nmonk, who, for a valuable consideration, imparted the secret to\\r\\nParacelsus.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cPardon me,â\\x80\\x9d cried the painter, â\\x80\\x9cit was first used by\\r\\nSolomon, as appears by a Greek manuscript in his civil handwriting,\\r\\nlately found at the foot of Mount Lebanon, by a peasant who was digging\\r\\nfor potatoesâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Wagtail, â\\x80\\x9cin all my vast reading, I never\\r\\nmet with such a preparation! neither did I know till this minute, that\\r\\nSolomon understood Greek, or that potatoes grew in Palestine.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Banter interposed, saying, he was surprised that Dr. Wagtail\\r\\nshould make the least doubt of Solomonâ\\x80\\x99s understanding Greek, when he\\r\\nis represented to us as the wisest and best-educated prince in the\\r\\nworld; and as for potatoes, they were transplanted thither from\\r\\nIreland, in the time of the Crusade, by some knights of that country.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI profess,â\\x80\\x9d said the doctor, â\\x80\\x9cthere is nothing more likely. I would\\r\\nactually give a vast sum for a sight of that manuscript, which must be\\r\\ninestimable; and, if I understood the process, would set about it\\r\\nimmediately.â\\x80\\x9d The player assured him the process was very simpleâ\\x80\\x94that\\r\\nhe must cram a hundred-weight of dry tinder into a glass retort, and,\\r\\ndistilling it by the force of animal heat, it would yield half a\\r\\nscruple of insipid water, one drop of which is a full dose. â\\x80\\x9cUpon my\\r\\nintegrity!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the incredulous doctor, â\\x80\\x9cthis is very amazing and\\r\\nextraordinary! that a caput mortuum should yield any water at all. I\\r\\nmust own I have always been an enemy to specifics which I thought\\r\\ninconsistent with the nature of the animal economy; but certainly the\\r\\nauthority of Solomon is not to be questioned. I wonder where I shall\\r\\nfind a glass retort large enough to contain such a vast quantity of\\r\\ntinder, the consumption of which must, undoubtedly, raise the price of\\r\\npaper, or where shall I find animal heat sufficient even to warm such a\\r\\nmass?â\\x80\\x9d Slyboot informed him, that he might have a retort blown for him\\r\\nas big as a church: and, that the easiest method of raising the vapour\\r\\nby animal heat, would be to place it in the middle of an infirmary for\\r\\nfeverish patients, who might be upon mattresses around and in contact\\r\\nwith it. He had he sooner pronounced these words, than Wagtail\\r\\nexclaimed in a rapture, â\\x80\\x9cAn admirable expedient, as I hope to be saved!\\r\\nI will positively put it in practice.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis simplicity of the physician furnished excellent diversion for the\\r\\ncompany, who, in their turns, sneered at him in ironical compliments,\\r\\nwhich his vanity swallowed as the genuine sentiments of their hearts.\\r\\nMr. Chatter, impatient of so long a silence, now broke out and\\r\\nentertained us with a catalogue of all the people who danced at the\\r\\nlast Hampstead assembly, with a most circumstantial account of the\\r\\ndress and ornaments of each, from the lappets of the ladies to the\\r\\nshoe-buckles of the men; concluding with telling Bragwell, that his\\r\\nmistress Melinda was there, and seemed to miss him: and soliciting his\\r\\ncompany at the next occasion of that kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, dâ\\x80\\x94mm,â\\x80\\x9d said Bragwell, â\\x80\\x9cI have something else to mind than dangling\\r\\nafter a parcel of giddy-headed girls; besides, you know my temper is so\\r\\nunruly, that I am apt to involve myself in scrapes when a woman is\\r\\nconcerned. The last time I was there, I had an affair with Tom\\r\\nTrippit.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh! I remember that!â\\x80\\x9d cried Banter; â\\x80\\x9cYou lugged out before\\r\\nthe ladies; and I commend you for so doing, because you had an\\r\\nopportunity of showing your manhood without running any risk.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cRisk!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid the other with a fierce countenance, â\\x80\\x9cdâ\\x80\\x94n my blood! I fear no\\r\\nrisks. I anâ\\x80\\x99t afraid of lugging out against any man that wears a head,\\r\\ndâ\\x80\\x94me! â\\x80\\x99Tis well known that I have drawn blood more than once, and lost\\r\\nsome too; but what does that signify?â\\x80\\x9d The player begged this champion\\r\\nto employ him as his second the next time he intended to kill, for he\\r\\nwanted to see a man die of a stab, that he might know how to act such\\r\\nan art the more naturally on the stage. â\\x80\\x9cDie!â\\x80\\x9d replied the hero: â\\x80\\x9cNo,\\r\\nby Gâ\\x80\\x94! I know better things than to incur the verdict of a Middlesex\\r\\njuryâ\\x80\\x94I should look upon my fencing-master to be an ignorant son of a\\r\\nbâ\\x80\\x94h, if he had not taught me to prick any of my antagonistâ\\x80\\x99s body that\\r\\nI please to disable.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOho!â\\x80\\x9d cried Slyboot, â\\x80\\x9cif that be the case, I\\r\\nhave a favour to ask. You must know I am employed to paint a Jesus on\\r\\nthe cross; and my purpose is to represent him at that point of time\\r\\nwhen the spear is thrust into his side. Now I should be glad if you\\r\\nwould, in my presence, pink some impertinent fellow into convulsions,\\r\\nwithout endangering his life, that I may have an opportunity of taking\\r\\na good clever agony from nature: the doctor will direct you where to\\r\\nenter and how far to go, but pray let it be as near the left side as\\r\\npossible.â\\x80\\x9d Wagtail, who took this proposal seriously, observed, that it\\r\\nwould be a very difficult matter to penetrate into the left side of the\\r\\nthorax without hurting the heart, and in consequence killing the\\r\\npatient; but he believed it was possible for a man of a very nice hand\\r\\nand exact knowledge of anatomy, to wound the diaphragma somewhere about\\r\\nthe skirts, which might induce a singultus, without being attended with\\r\\ndeath: that he was ready to demonstrate the insertion of that muscle to\\r\\nMr. Bragwell; but desired to have no concern with the experiment, which\\r\\nmight essentially prejudice his reputation, in case of a miscarriage.\\r\\nBragwell was as much imposed upon by the painterâ\\x80\\x99s waggery as the\\r\\ndoctor, and declined engaging in the affair, saying he held a very\\r\\ngreat regard for Mr. Slyboot, but had laid it down as a maxim, never to\\r\\nfight except when his honour was engaged. A thousand jokes of this kind\\r\\nwere uttered; the wine circulated, supper was served in, we ate\\r\\nheartily, returned to the bottle, Bragwell became noisy and\\r\\ntroublesome, Banter grew more and more severe, Ranter rehearsed,\\r\\nSlyboot made faces at the whole company, I sang French catches, and\\r\\nChatter kissed me with great affection; while the doctor, with a wofull\\r\\ncountenance, sat silent like a disciple of Pythagoras. At length, it\\r\\nwas proposed by Bragwell, that we should scour the hundreds, sweat the\\r\\nconstable, maul the watch, and then reel soberly to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we deliberated upon this expedition, the waiter came into the\\r\\nroom, and asked for Doctor Wagtail: when he understood he was present,\\r\\nhe told him there was a lady below to inquire for him, at which message\\r\\nthe physician started from his melancholy contemplation, and, with a\\r\\nlook of extreme confusion, assured the company he could not possibly be\\r\\nthe person wanted, for he had no connection with any lady whatever, and\\r\\nbade the drawer tell her so. â\\x80\\x9cFor shame!â\\x80\\x9d cried Banter; â\\x80\\x9cwould you be\\r\\nso impolite as to refuse a lady a hearing? perhaps she comes for a\\r\\nconsultation. It must be some extraordinary affair that brings a lady\\r\\nto a tavern at this time of night. Mr. Ranter, pray do the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbase-mains to the lady, and squire her hither.â\\x80\\x9d The player immediately\\r\\nstaggered out, and returned, leading in with much ceremony, a tall\\r\\nstrapping wench, whose appearance proclaimed her occupation. We\\r\\nreceived her with the utmost solemnity, and with a good deal of\\r\\nentreaty she was persuaded to sit, when a profound silence ensued,\\r\\nduring which she fixed her eyes, with a disconsolate look, upon the\\r\\ndoctor, who was utterly confounded at her behaviour, and returned her\\r\\nmelancholy fourfold; at length, after a good many piteous sighs, she\\r\\nwiped her eyes, and accosted him thus: â\\x80\\x9cWhat! not one word of comfort?\\r\\nWill nothing soften that stony heart of thine? Not all my tears! not\\r\\nall my affliction! not the inevitable ruin thou hast brought upon me!\\r\\nWhere are thy vows, thou faithless, perjured man? Hast thou no\\r\\nhonourâ\\x80\\x94no conscienceâ\\x80\\x94no remorse for thy perfidious conduct towards me?\\r\\nAnswer me, wilt thou at last do me justice, or must I have recourse to\\r\\nheaven or hell for my revenge?â\\x80\\x9d If poor Wagtail was amazed before she\\r\\nspoke, what must his confusion be on hearing this address! His natural\\r\\npaleness changed into a ghastly clay colour, his eyes rolled, his lip\\r\\ntrembled, and he answered in an accent not to be described, â\\x80\\x9cUpon my\\r\\nword, honour, and salvation, madam, you are actually mistaken in my\\r\\nperson. I have a most particular veneration for your sex, and, am\\r\\nactually incapable of injuring any lady in the smallest degree, madam;\\r\\nbesides, madam, to the best of my recollection, I never had the honour\\r\\nof seeing you before, as I hope to be saved, madam!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHow, traitor!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncried she, â\\x80\\x9cdost thou disown me then? Mistaken! no, too well I know\\r\\nthat fair bewitching face! too well I know that false enchanting\\r\\ntongue! Alas! gentlemen, since the villain compels me by his\\r\\nunkindness, to expose myself and him, know that this betrayer, under\\r\\nthe specious pretence of honourable addresses, won my heart, and taking\\r\\nadvantage of his conquest, robbed me of my virgin treasure, and\\r\\nafterwards abandoned me to my fate! I am now four months gone with\\r\\nchild by him, turned out of doors by my relations, and left a prey to\\r\\nmisery and want! Yes, thou barbarian,â\\x80\\x9d said she, turning to Wagtail,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthou tiger, thou succubus! too well thou knowest my situation. But I\\r\\nwill tear out thy faithless heart, and deliver the world from such a\\r\\nmonster.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, she sprang forward at the doctor, who with\\r\\nincredible agility, jumped over the table, and ran behind Bragwell,\\r\\nwhile the rest of us endeavoured to appease the furious heroine.\\r\\nAlthough everybody in the company affected the utmost surprise, I could\\r\\neasily perceive it was a scheme concerted among them to produce\\r\\ndiversion at the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s expense, and being under no concern about the\\r\\nconsequence, I entered into the confederacy, and enjoyed the distress\\r\\nof Wagtail, who with tears in his eyes begged the protection of the\\r\\ncompany, declaring himself as innocent of the crime laid to his charge\\r\\nas the foetus in utero; and hinting at the same time, that nature had\\r\\nnot put it in his power to be guilty of such a trespass. â\\x80\\x9cNature!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncried the lady, â\\x80\\x9cthere was no nature in the case; he abused me by the\\r\\nhelp of charms and spells; else how is it possible that any woman could\\r\\nhave listened to the addresses of such a scarecrow? Were these owlish\\r\\neyes made for ogling; that carrion complexion to be admired; or that\\r\\nmouth, like a horse-shoe, to be kissed? No, no, you owe your success to\\r\\nyour philtres, to your drugs and incantations; and not to your natural\\r\\ntalents, which are, in every respect, mean and contemptible.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor thought he had got an opportunity of vindicating himself\\r\\neffectually; and desired the complainant to compose herself but for\\r\\nhalf-an-hour, in which he undertook to prove the absurdity of believing\\r\\nin the power of incantations, which were only idle dreams of ignorance\\r\\nand superstition. He accordingly pronounced a very learned discourse\\r\\nupon the nature of ideas, the power and independence of the mind, the\\r\\nproperties of stimulating medicines, the difference between a proneness\\r\\nto venery, which many simples would create, and a passion limited to\\r\\none object, which can only be the result of sense and reflection; and\\r\\nconcluded with a pathetic remonstrance, setting forth his unhappiness\\r\\nin being persecuted with the resentment of a lady whom he had never\\r\\ninjured, nor even seen before that occasion, and whose faculties were,\\r\\nin all likelihood, so much impaired by her misfortunes that an innocent\\r\\nperson was in danger of being ruined by her disorder. He had no sooner\\r\\nfinished his harangue, than the forlorn princess renewed her\\r\\nlamentations, and cautioned the company against his eloquence, which,\\r\\nshe said, was able to bias the most impartial bench in Christendom.\\r\\nRanter advised him to espouse her immediately, as the only means to\\r\\nsave his reputation, and offered to accompany him to the Fleet for that\\r\\npurpose; but Slyboot proposed that a father should be purchased for the\\r\\nchild, and a comfortable alimony settled on the mother. Ranter promised\\r\\nto adopt the infant gratis. Wagtail was ready to worship him for his\\r\\ngenerosity, and, though he persisted in protesting his innocence,\\r\\ncondescended to everything rather than his unblemished character should\\r\\nbe called into question. The lady rejected the proposal, and insisted\\r\\non matrimony. Bragwell took up the cudgels for the doctor, and\\r\\nundertook to rid him of her importunity for half-a-guinea; upon which\\r\\nWagtail, with great eagerness, pulled out his purse, and put it into\\r\\nthe hand of his friend, who, taking half a piece out of it, gave it to\\r\\nthe plaintiff, and bade her thank God for her good fortune. When she\\r\\nhad received this bounty, she affected to weep, and begged, since the\\r\\nphysician had renounced her, he would at least vouchsafe her a parting\\r\\nkiss; this he was prevailed upon to grant with great reluctance, and\\r\\nwent up with his usual solemnity to salute her, when she laid hold of\\r\\nhis cheek with her teeth, and held fast, while he roared with anguish,\\r\\nto the unspeakable diversion of all present. When she thought proper to\\r\\nrelease him, she dropped a low courtesy to the company, and quitted the\\r\\nroom, leaving the doctor in the utmost horror, not so much on account\\r\\nof the pain, as the apprehension of the consequence of the bite; for,\\r\\nby this time, he was convinced of her being mad. Banter prescribed the\\r\\nactual cautery, and put the poker in the fire to be heated, in order to\\r\\nsear the place. The player was of opinion that Bragwell should scoop\\r\\nout the part affected with the point of his sword; but the painter\\r\\nprevented both these dreadful operations by recommending a balsam he\\r\\nhad in his pocket, which never failed to cure the bite of a mad dog; so\\r\\nsaying, he pulled out a small bladder of black paint, with which he\\r\\ninstantly anointed not only the sore, but the greatest part of the\\r\\npatientâ\\x80\\x99s face, and left it in a frightful condition. In short, the\\r\\npoor creature was so harassed with fear and vexation, that I pitied him\\r\\nextremely, and sent him home in a chair, contrary to the inclination of\\r\\neverybody present.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis freedom of mine gave umbrage to Bragwell, who testified his\\r\\ndispleasure by swearing a few threats, without making any application;\\r\\nwhich, being perceived by Slyboot, who sat by me, he, with a view of\\r\\npromoting a quarrel, whispered to me, that he thought Bragwell used me\\r\\nvery ill, but every man was the best judge of his own affairs. I\\r\\nanswered aloud, that I would neither suffer Mr. Bragwell nor him to use\\r\\nme ill with impunity; and that I stood in no need of his counsel in\\r\\nregard to the regulation of my conduct. He thought proper to ask a\\r\\nthousand pardons, and assure me he meant no offence; while Bragwell\\r\\nfeigned himself asleep, that he might not be obliged to take notice of\\r\\nwhat passed. But the player, who had more animal spirits and less\\r\\ndiscretion than Slyboot, unwilling to let the affair rest where he had\\r\\ndropped it, jogged Mr. Bragwell and told him softly that I had called\\r\\nhim names, and threatened to cudgel him. This particular I understood\\r\\nby his starting, up and crying, â\\x80\\x9cBlood and wounds, you lie! No man\\r\\ndurst treat me so ignominiously. Mr. Random, did you call me names, and\\r\\nthreaten to drub me?â\\x80\\x9d I denied the imputation, and proposed to punish\\r\\nthe scoundrel who endeavoured to foment disturbance in the company.\\r\\nBragwell signified his approbation, and drew his sword; I did the same,\\r\\nand accosted the actor in these words: â\\x80\\x9cLookee, Mr. Ranter; I know you\\r\\npossess all the mimicry and mischievous qualities of an ape, because I\\r\\nhave observed you put them all in practice more than once to-night, on\\r\\nme and others; now I want to see if you resemble one in nimbleness\\r\\nalso; therefore, I desire you leap over this sword without hesitation.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nSo saying, I held it parallel to the horizon, at the distance of about\\r\\nthree feet from the floor, and called, â\\x80\\x9cOnce-twice-thriceâ\\x80\\x94and away!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nbut, instead of complying with my demand, he snatched his hat and\\r\\nhanger, and, assuming the looks, swagger, and phrase of Pistol, burst\\r\\nout into the following exclamation, â\\x80\\x9cHa! must I then perform inglorious\\r\\nprank of sylvan ape in mountain forest caught! Death rock me asleep,\\r\\nabridge my doleful days, and lay my head in furyâ\\x80\\x99s lapâ\\x80\\x94Have we not\\r\\nHiren here?â\\x80\\x9d This buffoonery did not answer his expectation, for, by\\r\\nthis time, the company was bent on seeing him in a new character. Mr.\\r\\nBanter desired me to hold my sword a foot or two higher, that he might\\r\\nhave the better opportunity of exerting himself. The painter told him,\\r\\nif he performed well, he would recommend him as a vaulter to the\\r\\nproprietors of Sadlerâ\\x80\\x99s Wells; and Bragwell crying, â\\x80\\x9cLeap for the\\r\\nKing!â\\x80\\x9d applied the point of his sword to the playerâ\\x80\\x99s posteriors with\\r\\nsuch success, that he sprang over in a trice, and, finding the door\\r\\nunguarded, vanished in a twinkling; glad, no doubt, of having paid his\\r\\nshare of the reckoning so easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt being now near two oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning, we discharged the bill,\\r\\nand sallied out into the street. The painter slunk away without taking\\r\\nhis leave. Billy Chatter, being unable to speak or stand, was sent to a\\r\\nbagnio; and Banter and I accompanied Bragwell to Moll Kingâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncoffee-house, where after he had kicked half a dozen hungry whores, we\\r\\nleft him asleep on a bench, and directed our course towards\\r\\nCharing-cross, near which place both he and I lodged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe natural dryness of my companion being overcome by liquor, he\\r\\nhonoured me by the way with many compliments and professions, of\\r\\nfriendship, for which I made suitable acknowledgments, and told him I\\r\\nthought myself happy in having, by my behaviour, removed the\\r\\nunfavourable opinion he entertained of me at first sight. He was\\r\\nsurprised at this declaration, and begged me to explain myself; upon\\r\\nwhich I mentioned what I had overheard him say of me to Wagtail in the\\r\\ncoffee-house. He laughed, and made an apology for his freedom, assuring\\r\\nme, that my appearance had very much prepossessed him in my favour; and\\r\\nwhat he said was only intended as a joke on the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s solemnity. I\\r\\nwas highly pleased at being undeceived in this particular, and not a\\r\\nlittle proud of the good opinion of this wit, who shook me by the hand\\r\\nat parting, and promised to meet me the next day at the ordinary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStrap communicates to me a conquest he had made of a Chandlerâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nWidowâ\\x80\\x94finds himself miserably mistakenâ\\x80\\x94I go to the Operaâ\\x80\\x94admire\\r\\nMelindaâ\\x80\\x94am cautioned by Banterâ\\x80\\x94go to the Assembly at Hampsteadâ\\x80\\x94dance\\r\\nwith that young ladyâ\\x80\\x94receive an insolent message from Bragwell, whose\\r\\nmettle is soon cooledâ\\x80\\x94am in favour with my Mistress, whom I visit next\\r\\nday, and am bubbled out of eighteen guineas at cardsâ\\x80\\x94Strap triumphs at\\r\\nmy success, but is astonished at my expenseâ\\x80\\x94Banter comes to my lodging,\\r\\nis very sarcastic at my expense, and borrows five guineas from me, as a\\r\\nproof of his friendship\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning, before I got up, Strap came into my chamber, and,\\r\\nfinding me awake, hemmed several times, scratched his head, cast his\\r\\neyes upon the ground, and, with a very foolish kind of simper upon his\\r\\nface gave me to understand he had something to communicate. â\\x80\\x9cBy your\\r\\ncountenance,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cI expect to hear good tidings.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIndifferently,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nreplied he, tittering, â\\x80\\x9cthat is, hereafter as it shall be. You must\\r\\nknow, I have some thoughts of altering my condition.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWhat!â\\x80\\x9d cried I,\\r\\nastonished, â\\x80\\x9ca matrimonial scheme? O rare Strap! thou hast got the\\r\\nheels of me at last.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNâ\\x80\\x94no less, I assure you,â\\x80\\x9d said he, bursting into\\r\\na laugh of self-approbation: â\\x80\\x9ca tallow chandlerâ\\x80\\x99s widow that lives hard\\r\\nby, has taken a liking to me, a fine jolly dame, as plump as a\\r\\npartridge. She has a well-furnished house, a brisk trade, and a good\\r\\ndeal of the ready. I may have her for the asking. She told a friend of\\r\\nmine, a brother footman, that she would take me out of a stinking\\r\\nclout. But I refused to give my final answer, till I knew your opinion\\r\\nof the matter.â\\x80\\x9d I congratulated Monsieur dâ\\x80\\x99Estrapes upon his conquest,\\r\\nand approved of the scheme, provided he could be assured of those\\r\\ncircumstances of her fortune; but advised him to do nothing rashly, and\\r\\ngive me an opportunity of seeing the lady before matters should be\\r\\nbrought to a conclusion. He assured me he would do nothing without my\\r\\nconsent and approbation, and that very morning, while I was at\\r\\nbreakfast, introduce his inamorata to my acquaintance. She was a short\\r\\nthick woman, about the age of thirty-six, and had a particular\\r\\nprominence of belly, which I perceived at first sight, not without some\\r\\nsuspicion of foul play. I desired her, however, to sit, and treated her\\r\\nwith a dish of tea; the discourse turning on the good qualities of\\r\\nStrap, whom I represented as a prodigy of sobriety, industry and\\r\\nvirtue. When she took her leave, he followed her to the door, and\\r\\nreturned licking his lips, and asking if I did not think she was a\\r\\nluscious creature. I made no mystery of my apprehension, but declared\\r\\nmy sentiments of her without reserve; at which he was not surprised,\\r\\ntelling me he had observed the same symptom, but was informed by his\\r\\nfriend that she was only livergrown and would in few months be as small\\r\\nin the waist as ever. â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9ca few weeks, I believe, will do\\r\\nthe business. In short, Strap, it is my opinion, that you are\\r\\negregiously imposed upon; and that this friend is no other than a\\r\\nrascal who wants to palm his trull upon you for a wife, that he may at\\r\\nonce deliver himself from the importunities of the mother and the\\r\\nexpense of her bantling; for which reason I would not have you trust\\r\\nimplicitly to the report he makes of her wealth, which is inconsistent\\r\\nwith his behaviour, nor run your head precipitately into a noose, that\\r\\nyou may afterwards wish exchanged for the hangmanâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d He seemed very\\r\\nmuch startled at my insinuation, and promised to look twice before he\\r\\nleaped; saying, with some heat, â\\x80\\x9cOdds, if I find his intention is to\\r\\nbetray me, we shall see which of us is the better man.â\\x80\\x9d My prediction\\r\\nwas verified in less than a fortnight, her great belly producing an\\r\\ninfant, to the unspeakable amazement of Strap, who was before this\\r\\nhappened, inclinable to believe I had refined a little too much in my\\r\\npenetration. His false friend disappeared; and a few days after an\\r\\nexecution was issued against her goods and household furniture, which\\r\\nwere seized by the creditors.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile I met my friend Banter at the ordinary, and in the evening\\r\\nwent to the Opera with him and Mr Chatter, who pointed out Melinda in\\r\\none of the boxes, and offered to introduce me to her, observing at the\\r\\nsame time, that she was a reigning toast worth ten thousand pounds.\\r\\nThis piece of information made my heart bound with joy, and I\\r\\ndiscovered great eagerness to accept the proposal; upon which he\\r\\nassured me I should dance with her at the next assembly, if he had any\\r\\ninfluence in that quarter: so saying, he went round, spoke to her some\\r\\nminutes, and, as I imagined, pointed at me; then returning, told me, to\\r\\nmy inexpressible pleasure, that I might depend upon what he had\\r\\npromised, for she was now engaged as my partner. Banter in a whisper,\\r\\ngave me to understand that she was an incorrigible coquette, who would\\r\\ngrant the same favour to any young fellow in England of a tolerable\\r\\nappearance, merely to engage him among the herd of her admirers, that\\r\\nshe might have the pleasure of seeing them daily increase; that she was\\r\\nof a cold insensible disposition, dead to every passion but vanity, and\\r\\nso blind to merit, that he would lay any wager the wealthiest fool\\r\\nwould carry her at last. I attributed a good deal of this intelligence\\r\\nto the satirical turn of my friend, or resentment for having himself\\r\\nsuffered a rebuff from the lady in question, and, at any rate, trusted\\r\\nso much to my own accomplishments as to believe no woman could resist\\r\\nthe ardour of my addresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nFull of this confidence I repaired to Hampstead in company with Billy\\r\\nChatter, my Lord Hobble, and Doctor Wagtail. There I saw a very\\r\\nbrilliant assembly, before whom I had the honour to walk a minuet with\\r\\nMelinda, who charmed me with her frank manner and easiness of\\r\\nbehaviour. Before the country dances began, I received a message by a\\r\\nperson I did not know from Bragwell, who was present, importing that\\r\\nnobody who knew him presumed to dance with Melinda while he was there\\r\\nin person, that I would do well to relinquish her without noise,\\r\\nbecause he had a mind to lead up a country dance with her. This\\r\\nextraordinary intimation, which was delivered in the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s hearing,\\r\\ndid not at all discompose me, who, by this time, was pretty well\\r\\nacquainted with the character of my rival. I therefore, without the\\r\\nleast symptom of concern bade the gentleman tell Mr. Bragwell, that\\r\\nsince I was so happy as to obtain the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s consent, I should not be\\r\\nsolicitous about his; and desired the bearer himself to bring me no\\r\\nsuch impertinent messages for the future. Melinda, affected a sort of\\r\\nconfusion, and pretended to wonder that Mr. Bragwell should give\\r\\nhimself such liberties with regard to her, who had no manner of\\r\\nconnection with the fellow. I laid hold of this opportunity to display\\r\\nmy valour, and offered to call him to an account for his insolence, a\\r\\nproposal which she absolutely refused, under pretence of consulting my\\r\\nsafety; though I could perceive, by the sparkling of her eyes, that she\\r\\nwould not have thought herself affronted by being the subject of a\\r\\nduel. I was by no means pleased with this discovery of her thoughts,\\r\\nwhich not only argued the most unjustifiable vanity, but likewise the\\r\\nmost barbarous indifference; however, I was allured by her fortune, and\\r\\nresolved to gratify her pride, in making her the occasion of a public\\r\\nquarrel between me and Bragwell, who, I was pretty certain, would never\\r\\ndrive matters to a dangerous extremity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we danced together, I observed this formidable rival at one end\\r\\nof the room, encircled with a cluster of beaux, to whom he talked with\\r\\ngreat vehemence, casting many big looks at me from time to time. I\\r\\nguessed the subject of his discourse, and as soon as I had handed my\\r\\npartner to her seat, strutted up to the place where he stood, and,\\r\\ncocking my hat in his face, demanded aloud, if he had anything to say\\r\\nto me. He answered with a sullen tone, â\\x80\\x9cNothing, at present, sir;â\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\nturned about upon his heel. â\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cyou know where I am to be\\r\\nfound at any time.â\\x80\\x9d His companions stared at one another, and I\\r\\nreturned to the lady, whose features brightened at my approach, and\\r\\nimmediately a whisper ran through the whole room; after which so many\\r\\neyes were turned upon me that I was ready to sink with confusion. When\\r\\nthe ball broke up, I led her to her coach, and, like a true French\\r\\ngallant, would have got up behind it, in order to protect her from\\r\\nviolence on the road, but she absolutely refused my offer, and\\r\\nexpressed her concern that there was not an empty seat for me within\\r\\nthe vehicle.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day, in the afternoon, I waited on her at her lodgings, by\\r\\npermission, in company with Chatter, and was very civilly received by\\r\\nher mother, with whom she lived. There were a good many fashionable\\r\\npeople present, chiefly young fellows, and immediately after tea, a\\r\\ncouple of card tables were set, at one of which I had the honour to\\r\\nplay with Melinda, who in less than three hours, made shift to plunder\\r\\nme of eight guineas. I was well enough content to lose a little money\\r\\nwith a good grace, that I might have an opportunity in the meantime to\\r\\nsay soft things, which are still most welcome when attended with good\\r\\nluck; but I was by no means satisfied of her fair play, a circumstance\\r\\nthat shocked me not a little, and greatly impaired my opinion of her\\r\\ndisinterestedness and delicacy. However, I was resolved to profit by\\r\\nthis behaviour, and treat her in my turn with less ceremony;\\r\\naccordingly, I laid close siege to her, and, finding her not at all\\r\\ndisgusted with the gross incense I offered, that very night made a\\r\\ndeclaration of love in plain terms. She received my addresses with\\r\\ngreat gaiety, and pretended to laugh them off, but at the same time\\r\\ntreated me with such particular complacency that I was persuaded I had\\r\\nmade a conquest of her heart, and concluded myself the happiest man\\r\\nalive. Elevated with these flattering ideas, I sat down again to cards\\r\\nafter supper, and with great cheerfulness suffered myself to be cheated\\r\\nof ten guineas more.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late before I took my leave, after being favoured with a general\\r\\ninvitation; and, when I got into bed, the adventures of the day\\r\\nhindered me from sleeping. Sometimes I pleased myself with the hopes of\\r\\npossessing a fine woman with ten thousand pounds; then I would ruminate\\r\\non the character I had heard of her from Banter, and compare it with\\r\\nthe circumstances of her conduct towards me, which seemed to bear too\\r\\ngreat a resemblance to the picture he had drawn. This introduced a\\r\\nmelancholy reflection on the expense I had undergone, and the smallness\\r\\nof my funds to support it, which, by-the-by, were none of my own. In\\r\\nshort, I found myself involved in doubts and perplexities, that kept me\\r\\nawake the greatest part of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning, Strap, with whom I had not conversed for two days,\\r\\npresented himself with the utensils for shaving me; upon which, I asked\\r\\nhis opinion of the lady he had seen me conduct to her coach at\\r\\nHampstead. â\\x80\\x9cOdds! sheâ\\x80\\x99s a delicious creature!â\\x80\\x9d cried he, â\\x80\\x9cand, as I am\\r\\ninformed, a great fortune. I am sorry you did not insist on going home\\r\\nwith her. I dare say, she would not have refused your company; for she\\r\\nseems to be a good-humoured soul.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a time for all things,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid I, â\\x80\\x9cyou must know, Strap, I was in company with her till one\\r\\noâ\\x80\\x99clock this morning.â\\x80\\x9d I had no sooner pronounced these words than he\\r\\nbegan to caper about the room, and snap his fingers, crying in a\\r\\ntransport, â\\x80\\x9cThe dayâ\\x80\\x99s our ownâ\\x80\\x94the dayâ\\x80\\x99s our own!â\\x80\\x9d I gave him to\\r\\nunderstand that his triumph was a little premature, and that I had more\\r\\ndifficulties to surmount than he was aware of; then I recounted to him\\r\\nthe intelligence I had received from Banter. At which he changed\\r\\ncolour, shook his head, and observed there was no faith in woman. I\\r\\ntold him I was resolved to make a bold push notwithstanding, although I\\r\\nforesaw it would lead me into a great expense; and bade him guess the\\r\\nsum I had lost last night at cards. He scratched his chin, and\\r\\nprotested his abhorrence of cards, the very name of which being\\r\\nmentioned, made him sweat with vexation, as it recalled the\\r\\nmoney-dropper to his remembrance. â\\x80\\x9cBut, however,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cyou have to\\r\\ndo with other guess people now. Why, I suppose, if you had a bad run\\r\\nlast night, you would scarce come off for less than ten or twelve\\r\\nshilling.â\\x80\\x9d I was mortified at this piece of simplicity, which I\\r\\nimagined, at that time, was all affected by way of reprimand for my\\r\\nfolly; and asked with some heat if he thought I had spent the evening\\r\\nin a cellar with chairmen and bunters; giving him to know, at the same\\r\\ntime, that my expense had amounted to eighteen guineas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would require the pencil of Hogarth to express the astonishment and\\r\\nconcern of Strap on hearing this piece of news; the basin, in which he\\r\\nwas preparing the lather for my chin, dropped out of his hands, and he\\r\\nremained some time immovable in that ludicrous attitude, with his mouth\\r\\nopen, and his eyes thrust forward considerably beyond their station;\\r\\nbut, remembering my disposition, which was touchy, and impatient of\\r\\ncontrol, he smothered his chagrin, and attempted to recollect himself.\\r\\nWith this view he endeavoured to laugh, but in spite if his teeth,\\r\\nbroke out in a whimper, took up his wash-ball and pewter-pot, scrubbed\\r\\nmy beard with the one, and discharged the other upon my face. I took no\\r\\nnotice of this confusion, but after he had fully recovered himself, put\\r\\nhim in mind of his right, and assured him of my readiness to surrender\\r\\nmy effects whenever he should think proper to demand them. He was\\r\\nnettled at my insinuation, which he thought proceeded from my distrust\\r\\nof his friendship; and begged I would never talk to him in that strain\\r\\nagain, unless I had a mind to break his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis good creatureâ\\x80\\x99s unalterable friendship for me affected me with the\\r\\nmost grateful sentiments, and acted as a spur to my resolution of\\r\\nacquiring a fortune, that I might have it in my power to manifest my\\r\\ngenerosity in my turn. For this purpose, I determined to bring matters\\r\\nto a speedy conclusion with Melinda; well knowing that a few such\\r\\nnights as the last would effectually incapacitate me from prosecuting\\r\\nthat or any other advantageous amour.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile my meditation was busied in planning out my future conduct, Mr.\\r\\nBanter favoured me with a visit, and after breakfast asked how I had\\r\\npassed the preceding evening. I answered I was very agreeably\\r\\nentertained at a private house. â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said he, with a sarcastic smile,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou deserve something extraordinary for the price you paid.â\\x80\\x9d I was\\r\\nsurprised at this remark, and pretended ignorance of his meaning.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, come, Mr. Random,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, â\\x80\\x9cyou need not make a mystery of\\r\\nit to me; the whole town has it. I wish that foolish affair between you\\r\\nand Bragwell at Hampstead had been less public. It has set all the\\r\\nbusybodies at work to find out your real character and situation; and\\r\\nyou cannot imagine what conjectures have already circulated at your\\r\\nexpense. One suspects you to be a Jesuit in disguise; another thinks\\r\\nyou are an agent from the Pretender; a third believes you to be an\\r\\nupstart gamester, because nobody knows anything of your family or\\r\\nfortune; a fourth is of opinion that you are an Irish fortune-hunter.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThis last hypothesis touched me so nearly that, to conceal my\\r\\nconfusion, I was fain to interrupt his detail, and damn the world for\\r\\nan envious meddling community, that would not suffer a gentleman to\\r\\nlive without molestation. He took no notice of this apostrophe, but\\r\\nwent on. â\\x80\\x9cFor my own part, I neither know nor desire to know who or\\r\\nwhat you are. This I am certain of, that few people make a mystery of\\r\\ntheir origin or situation, who can boast of anything advantageous in\\r\\neither; and my own opinion of the matter is that you have raised\\r\\nyourself, by your industry, from nothing to the appearance you now\\r\\nmaintain, and which you endeavour to support by some matrimonial\\r\\nscheme.â\\x80\\x9d Here he fixed his eyes steadfastly upon me and perceiving my\\r\\nface covered with blushes, told me, how he was confirmed in his\\r\\nopinion. â\\x80\\x9cLook ye, Random,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI have divined your plan, and am\\r\\nconfident it will never succeed. You are too honest and too ignorant of\\r\\nthe town to practise the necessary cheats of your profession, and\\r\\ndetect the conspiracies that will be formed against you. Besides, you\\r\\nare downright bashful. What the devil! set up for a fortune hunter\\r\\nbefore you have conquered the sense of shame! Perhaps you are entitled\\r\\nby your merit, and I believe you are, to a richer and a better wife\\r\\nthan Melinda; but take my word for it, she is not to be won at that\\r\\nrate;â\\x80\\x94or, if you are so lucky as to carry her, between you and me, you\\r\\nmay say, as Teague said, By my soul, I have gained a loss! She would\\r\\ntake care to spend her fortune in a twinkling, and soon make you sick\\r\\nof her extravagance.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was alarmed by his discourse, while I resented the freedom of it, and\\r\\nexpressed my disgust by telling him, he was mistaken in my intentions,\\r\\nand desiring he would give me leave to regulate my conduct according to\\r\\nthe dictates of my own reason. He made no apology for the liberty he\\r\\nhad taken, and ascribed it to the warmth of his friendship for me; as\\r\\nan uncommon instance of which he borrowed five guineas, assuring me\\r\\nthere were very few people in the world whom he would so far favour\\r\\nwith his confidence. I gave him the money, and professed myself so well\\r\\nconvinced of his sincerity, that he had no occasion to put it to such\\r\\nextraordinary proofs for the future. â\\x80\\x9cI thought,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cto have\\r\\nasked five pieces more, but hearing you were bubbled of eighteen last\\r\\nnight, I presumed you might be out of cash, and resolved to model my\\r\\ndemand accordingly.â\\x80\\x9d I could not help admiring the cavalier behaviour\\r\\nof this spark, of whom I desired to know his reason for saying I was\\r\\nbubbled. He then gave me to understand, that before he came to my\\r\\nlodgings, he had beat up Tom Tossle, who, being present, informed him\\r\\nof the particulars, rehearsed all the fine things I said to Melinda,\\r\\nwith which he proposed to entertain the town, and among other\\r\\ncircumstances, assured him my mistress cheated with so little art, that\\r\\nnobody but a mere novice could be imposed upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thoughts of becoming a subject of raillery for coxcombs, and losing\\r\\nmy money to boot, stung me to the quick; but I made a virtue of my\\r\\nindignation, and swore that no man should with impunity either asperse\\r\\nthe character of Melinda, or turn my behaviour into ridicule. He\\r\\nreplied in a dry manner, that I would find it a Herculean task to\\r\\nchastise everybody who should laugh at my expense; and, as for the\\r\\ncharacter of Melinda, he did not see how it could suffer by what was\\r\\nlaid to her charge; for that cheating at cards, far from being reckoned\\r\\na blemish among people of fashion, was looked upon as an honourable\\r\\nindication of superior genius and address. â\\x80\\x9cBut let us waive this\\r\\nsubject,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cand go to the coffee-house, in order to make a\\r\\nparty for dinner.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe repair to the coffee-house, where we overhear a curious dispute\\r\\nbetween Wagtail and Medlar, which is referred to our decisionâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nDoctor gives an account of his experimentâ\\x80\\x94Medlar is roasted by Banter\\r\\nat the ordinaryâ\\x80\\x94the old gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s advice to me\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing as willing to drop the theme as he was to propose it, I\\r\\naccompanied him thither, where we found Mr. Medlar and Dr. Wagtail\\r\\ndisputing upon the word Custard, which the physician affirmed should be\\r\\nspelt with a G, observing that it was derived from the Latin verb\\r\\ngustare, â\\x80\\x9cto taste;â\\x80\\x9d but Medlar pleaded custom in behalf of C,\\r\\nobserving, that, by the Doctorâ\\x80\\x99s rule, we ought to change pudding into\\r\\nbudding, because it is derived from the French word boudin; and in that\\r\\ncase why not retain the original orthography and pronunciation of all\\r\\nthe foreign words we have adopted, by which means our language would\\r\\nbecome a dissonant jargon without standard or propriety? The\\r\\ncontroversy was referred to us; and Banter, notwithstanding his real\\r\\nopinion to the contrary, decided it in favour of Wagtail; upon which\\r\\nthe peevish annuitant arose, and uttering the monosyllable pish! with\\r\\ngreat emphasis, removed to another table.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe then inquired of the doctor, what progress he had made in the\\r\\nexperiment of distilling tinder-water; and he told us he had been at\\r\\nall the glass-houses about town, but could find nobody who would\\r\\nundertake to blow a retort large enough to hold the third part of the\\r\\nquantity prescribed; but he intended to try the process on as much as\\r\\nwould produce five drops, which would be sufficient to prove the\\r\\nspecific, and then he would make it a parliamentary affair; that he had\\r\\nalready purchased a considerable weight of rags, in reducing which to\\r\\ntinder, he had met with a misfortune, which had obliged him to change\\r\\nhis lodgings; for he had gathered them in a heap on the floor, and set\\r\\nfire to them with a candle, on the supposition that the boards would\\r\\nsustain no damage, because it is the nature of flame to ascend; but, by\\r\\nsome very extraordinary accident, the wood was invaded, and began to\\r\\nblaze with great violence, which disordered him so much, that he had\\r\\nnot the presence of mind enough to call for assistance, and the whole\\r\\nhouse must have been consumed with him in the midst of it, had not the\\r\\nsmoke that rolled out of the windows in clouds alarmed the\\r\\nneighbourhood, and brought people to his succour: that he had lost a\\r\\npair of black velvet breeches and a tie-wig in the hurry, besides the\\r\\nexpense of the rags, which were rendered useless by the water used to\\r\\nquench the flame, and the damage of the floor, which he was compelled\\r\\nto repair; that his landlord, believing him distracted, had insisted on\\r\\nhis quitting his apartment at a minuteâ\\x80\\x99s warning, and he was put to\\r\\nincredible inconvenience; but now he was settled in a very comfortable\\r\\nhouse, and had the use of a large paved yard for preparing his tinder;\\r\\nso that he hoped in a very short time to reap the fruits of his labour.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having congratulated the doctor on his prospect, and read the\\r\\npapers, we repaired to an auction of pictures, where we entertained\\r\\nourselves an hour or two; from thence we adjourned to the Mall, and,\\r\\nafter two or three turns, went back to dinner, Banter assuring us, that\\r\\nhe intended to roast Medlar at the ordinary; and, indeed, we were no\\r\\nsooner set than this cynic began to execute his purpose, by telling the\\r\\nold gentleman that he looked extremely well, considering the little\\r\\nsleep he had enjoyed last night. To this compliment Medlar made no\\r\\nreply, but by a stare, accompanied with a significant grin; and Banter\\r\\nwent on thus; â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether most to admire the charity of your\\r\\nmind, or the vigour of your body. Upon my soul, Mr. Medlar, you do\\r\\ngenerous things with the best taste of any man I know! You extend your\\r\\ncompassion to real objects, and exact only such returns as they are\\r\\ncapable of making. You must know, gentlemen,â\\x80\\x9d said he, turning to the\\r\\ncompany, â\\x80\\x9cI had been up most part of the night with a friend who is ill\\r\\nof a fever, and, on my return home this morning, chanced to pass by a\\r\\ngin shop still open, whence issued a confused sound of mirth and\\r\\njollity: upon which, I popped in my head, and perceived Mr. Medlar\\r\\ndancing bareheaded in the midst of ten or twenty ragged bunters, who\\r\\nrejoiced at his expense. But indeed, Mr. Medlar, you should not\\r\\nsacrifice your constitution to your benevolence. Consider, you grow old\\r\\napace; and, therefore, have a reverend care of your health, which must\\r\\ncertainly be very much impaired by these nocturnal expeditions.â\\x80\\x9d The\\r\\ntesty senior could no longer contain himself, but cried hastily, â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Tis\\r\\nwell known that your tongue is no slanderer.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI think,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nother, â\\x80\\x9cyou might spare that observation, as you are very sensible,\\r\\nthat my tongue has done you signal service on many occasions. You may\\r\\nremember, that, when you made your addresses to the fat widow who kept\\r\\na public-house at Islington, there was a report spread very much to the\\r\\nprejudice of your manhood, which coming to the ears of your mistress,\\r\\nyou were discarded immediately: and I brought matters to a\\r\\nreconciliation, by assuring her you had three bastards at nurse in the\\r\\ncountry. How you ruined your own affair afterwards, it is neither my\\r\\nbusiness nor inclination to relate.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis anecdote, which had no other foundation than in Banterâ\\x80\\x99s own\\r\\ninvention, afforded a good deal of mirth to everybody present, and\\r\\nprovoked Mr. Medlar beyond all sufferance; so that he started up in a\\r\\nmighty passion, and, forgetting that his mouth was full, bespattered\\r\\nthose who sat next to him, while he discharged his indignation in a\\r\\nvolley of oaths, and called Banter insignificant puppy, impertinent\\r\\njackanapes, and a hundred such appellations; telling the company he had\\r\\ninvented these false and malicious aspersions, because he would not\\r\\nlend him money to squander away upon rooks and whores. â\\x80\\x9cA very likely\\r\\nstory,â\\x80\\x9d said Banter, â\\x80\\x9cthat I should attempt to borrow money of a man\\r\\nwho is obliged to practise a thousand shifts to make his weekly\\r\\nallowance hold out till Saturday night. Sometimes he sleeps\\r\\nfour-and-twenty hours at a stretch, by which means he saves three\\r\\nmeals, besides coffee-house expense. Sometimes he is fain to put up\\r\\nwith bread and cheese and small beer for dinner; and sometimes he\\r\\nregales on twopennyworth of ox cheek in a cellar.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYou are a lying\\r\\nmiscreant!â\\x80\\x9d cried Medlar, in an ecstacy of rage; â\\x80\\x9cI can always command\\r\\nmoney enough to pay your tailorâ\\x80\\x99s bill, which I am sure is no trifle;\\r\\nand I have a good mind to give you a convincing proof of my\\r\\ncircumstances, by prosecuting you for defamation, sirrah.â\\x80\\x9d By this time\\r\\nthe violence of his wrath had deprived him of his appetite, and he sat\\r\\nsilent, unable to swallow one mouthful, while his tormentor enjoyed his\\r\\nmortification, and increased his chagrin, by advising him to lay in\\r\\nplentifully for his next dayâ\\x80\\x99s fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner being ended, we came down stairs to the coffee room, and Banter\\r\\nwent away to keep an appointment, saying, he supposed he should see\\r\\nWagtail and me in the evening at the Bedford Coffee-house. He was no\\r\\nsooner gone than the old gentleman took me aside, and said, he was\\r\\nsorry to see me so intimate with that fellow, who was one of the most\\r\\ngraceless rakes about town, and had already wasted a good estate and\\r\\nconstitution upon harlots; that he had been the ruin of many a young\\r\\nman, by introducing them into debauched company, and setting a lewd\\r\\nexample of all manner of wickedness; and that, unless I were on my\\r\\nguard, he would strip me in a short time both of my money and\\r\\nreputation. I thanked him for his information, and promised to conduct\\r\\nmyself accordingly, wishing, however, his caution had been a few hours\\r\\nmore early, by which means I might have saved five guineas.\\r\\nNotwithstanding this intelligence, I was inclinable to impute some part\\r\\nof the charge to Medlarâ\\x80\\x99s revenge for the liberties taken with him at\\r\\ndinner; and therefore, as soon as I could disengage myself, applied to\\r\\nWagtail for his opinion of the character in question, resolved to\\r\\ncompare their accounts, allowing for the prejudice of each, and to form\\r\\nmy judgment upon both, without adhering strictly to either. The doctor\\r\\nassured me, that he was a very pretty gentleman of family and fortune;\\r\\na scholar, a wit, a critic, and perfectly well acquainted with the\\r\\ntown; that his honour and courage were unquestionable, though some\\r\\nextravagances he had been guilty of, and his talents for satire had\\r\\nprocured him enemies, and made some people shy of his acquaintance.\\r\\nFrom these different sketches, I concluded that Banter was a young\\r\\nfellow of some parts, who had spent his fortune, but retained his\\r\\nappetites, and fallen out with the world, because he could not enjoy it\\r\\nto his wish.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to the Bedford Coffee-house in the evening, where I met my\\r\\nfriends, from thence proceeded to the play, and afterwards carried them\\r\\nhome to my lodgings, where we supped in great good humour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XLIX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI receive a Challengeâ\\x80\\x94the Consequence of itâ\\x80\\x94the Quarrel being made up,\\r\\nam put in Arrest by the Care and Affection of Strapâ\\x80\\x94but immediately\\r\\nreleased upon explaining my Affairâ\\x80\\x94the Behaviour of Mr. Oregan and his\\r\\ntwo Friendsâ\\x80\\x94I visit Melinda, whom I divert with an account of the\\r\\nDuelâ\\x80\\x94propose Marriageâ\\x80\\x94she refers the Matter to her Mother, of whom I\\r\\nmake a solemn Demand of her Daughterâ\\x80\\x94the old Ladyâ\\x80\\x99s behaviourâ\\x80\\x94I am\\r\\ndiscardedâ\\x80\\x94-resent their Disdain\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was ready to go abroad next day, Strap brought me a letter, To\\r\\nMr. Random, Esq., these; which, upon opening, I found contained a\\r\\nchallenge conceived in these very extraordinary terms:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x94Whereas I am informed that you make love to Miss Melinda\\r\\nGoosetrap, this is to let you know that she is under promise of\\r\\nmarriage to me; and that I am at this present waiting at the back of\\r\\nMontague House, with a pair of good pistols in my hand; and if you will\\r\\nkeep your appointment, I will make your tongue confess (after the\\r\\nbreath is out of your body) that you do not deserve her so well as\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYours, etc.\\r\\nRourk Oregan.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI guessed, from the style and superscription of this billet, that my\\r\\nrival was a true Milesian, and was not a little uneasy at the contents;\\r\\nespecially that part, in which he asserted his right to my mistress by\\r\\npromise, a circumstance I did not not know how to reconcile to her good\\r\\nsense and penetration. However, this was no time for me to decline the\\r\\ndefiance, because the success of my addresses in a great measure\\r\\ndepended upon my behaviour in that affair. I therefore immediately\\r\\nloaded my pistols, and betook myself in a hackney coach to the place\\r\\nappointed, where I found a tall raw-boned man, with a hard-featured\\r\\ncountenance and black bushy beard, walking by himself, wrapped up in a\\r\\nshabby green coat, over which his own hair descended in leathern queue\\r\\nfrom his head, that was covered with a greasy hat trimmed with a\\r\\ntarnished pointe dâ\\x80\\x99Espagne. He had no sooner perceived me advancing\\r\\nthan he pulled a pistol from his bosom, and, presenting it at me,\\r\\nsnapped it without the least preamble. Alarmed at this rude salutation,\\r\\nI made a stand, and, before he could adjust his other piece, fired one\\r\\nof mine at him, without doing any damage, By this time he was ready\\r\\nwith his second, that flashed in the pan without going off; upon which\\r\\nhe called, with a true Tipperary cadence, â\\x80\\x9cFire away, honey!â\\x80\\x9d and began\\r\\nto hammer his flint with great deliberation. But I was resolved to make\\r\\nuse of the advantage fortune had given me, and therefore stepped up\\r\\nwithout throwing away my fire, desiring him to ask his life, or prepare\\r\\nfor another world; but this stout Hibernian refused to condescend, and\\r\\ncomplained bitterly of my having quitted my ground before he could\\r\\nreturn my shot: saying I ought to go back to my station, and let him\\r\\nhave an equal chance with me. I endeavoured to persuade him that I had\\r\\ngiven him a double chance already: and it was my business to prevent\\r\\nhim from enjoying a third; but now, since I had an opportunity, I\\r\\ndemanded a parley, and desired to know his condition and reason for\\r\\ncalling me to the field, who, to the best of my remembrance, far from\\r\\nhaving done him any injury, had never before seen him. He told me that\\r\\nhe was a gentleman of fortune, who had spent all he had, and, hearing\\r\\nthat Melinda had got ten thousand pounds, he intended to make himself\\r\\nmaster of that sum by espousing her, and he was determined, in an\\r\\nhonourable way, to cut the throats of all those who stood between him\\r\\nand his hopes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then demanded to know the foundation of his hopes; and now that I had\\r\\nseen him, being more and more astonished at the circumstance of the\\r\\npromise, desired that he would explain that mystery. He gave me to\\r\\nunderstand, that he trusted entirely to his birth and personal merit;\\r\\nthat he had frequently written to Melinda, setting forth his claim and\\r\\npretensions, but she was never kind enough to send an answer, or even\\r\\nto admit him into her presence; and that the promise he mentioned in\\r\\nhis letter was made by his friend Mr. Gahagan, who assured him that no\\r\\nwoman could resist a man of his appearance. I could not forbear\\r\\nlaughing to excess at the simplicity of my rival, who did not seem to\\r\\nrelish my mirth, but began to be very serious: upon which I endeavoured\\r\\nto appease him, by giving him my word and honour that, far from\\r\\nprejudicing his addresses to the lady, I would represent him to her in\\r\\nthe most favourable light I could with any regard to truth; but he must\\r\\nnot be surprised if she should remain blind to his deserts, for nothing\\r\\nwas more capricious than a womanâ\\x80\\x99s mind, and the affection of that sex\\r\\nwas seldom purchased with virtue alone. That my declaration might have\\r\\nthe better effect, I took notice of his deshabille, and, professing\\r\\nsorrow at seeing a gentleman reduced, slipped two guineas into his\\r\\nhand, at sight of which he threw away his pistols, and hugging me in\\r\\nhis arms, cried, â\\x80\\x9cArrah, by Jasus, now, you are the best friend I have\\r\\nmet with these seven long years!â\\x80\\x9d When I had suffered some minutes in\\r\\nhis embrace, he quitted me, and picking up his rusty arms, wished the\\r\\ndevil might burn him if ever he should give me any further trouble\\r\\nabout womankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quarrel being thus amicably composed, I begged leave to look at his\\r\\npistols, which I found so crazy and so foul, that I believe it was\\r\\nhappy for him neither of them was discharged, for one of them would\\r\\ncertainly have split in the going off, and he would, in all\\r\\nprobability, have lost his hand in the explosion; but what gave me a\\r\\nlively idea of the manâ\\x80\\x99s character was, to find, upon examination, that\\r\\none of them had been loaded without being primed, and the other primed\\r\\nwithout a charge.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we walked home together, I expressed a desire of knowing my new\\r\\nfriendâ\\x80\\x99s history; and he informed me of his having served in the German\\r\\narmy as a volunteer against the Turks; that for his behaviour at the\\r\\nsiege of Belgrade, he had been honoured with an ensignâ\\x80\\x99s commission,\\r\\nand afterwards promoted to the rank of lieutenant, in which station it\\r\\nwas his misfortune to affront his captain, who challenged him to the\\r\\nfield, and was killed in the duel, upon which he was obliged to\\r\\nretreat; that he had been in England some years soliciting his friends\\r\\nfor provision in the British army; but being hitherto unsuccessful, was\\r\\ndesired by Mr. Gahagan to turn his thoughts to matrimony, and make his\\r\\nfortune by an advantageous match; in consequence of which advice, he\\r\\nhad made up to Melinda: and, having heard by means of an Irish footman\\r\\nin the family, that I was her chief favourite, had called me out in\\r\\nhopes of removing by my death the greatest obstruction to his desires;\\r\\nbut now he was convinced of my honour and generosity, he swore by the\\r\\nblessed Virgin, he would think of her no more, if there were not\\r\\nanother woman in the world. As a further proof of his veracity, which I\\r\\ndid not at all doubt, he opened an old iron snuff-box, and pulled out\\r\\nhis commission in the Imperial army, and his captainâ\\x80\\x99s challenge, which\\r\\nhe preserved as testimonials of his character. I was so well convinced\\r\\nof this poor manâ\\x80\\x99s honesty and courage, that I determined to speak in\\r\\nhis behalf to some of my acquaintance, who might recommend his case to\\r\\nthe consideration of those who could provide for him; and in the\\r\\nmeantime to accommodate him with a few clothes, by which his appearance\\r\\nwould be much mended, and himself enabled to renew his solicitations in\\r\\nperson.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we walked along conversing socially together, we were met by a file\\r\\nof musketeers, and Strap at their head, who no sooner approached than,\\r\\nwith a frantic look, he cried, â\\x80\\x9cSeize them! In the name of God seize\\r\\nthem!â\\x80\\x9d We were accordingly surrounded, and I put in arrest by the\\r\\ncorporal, who was commanding officer; but Captain Oregan disengaged\\r\\nhimself, and ran with such speed towards Tottenham Court Road that he\\r\\nwas out of sight in a moment. When my arms were delivered up, and\\r\\nmyself secured, Strap became a little more composed, and asked pardon\\r\\nfor the liberty he had taken, which he hoped I would excuse, as it\\r\\nproceeded from his affection. He then told me that, suspecting the\\r\\nletter (which by the by was brought by the author himself) contained\\r\\nsomething extraordinary, he had peeped through the keyhole, and seen me\\r\\nload my pistols; upon which he ran down to Whitehall, and applied to\\r\\nthe officer on guard for a party to put me in arrest, but before he\\r\\nreturned, I was gone in a coach; that he had inquired which way I went,\\r\\nand, having heard that duels were commonly fought at the back of\\r\\nMontague House, he conducted the guard to this place, where he thanked\\r\\nGod for having found me safe and sound. I gave him to understand that I\\r\\nforgave his officious concern for once, but cautioned him in pretty\\r\\nsevere terms for making me the subject of idle conversation for the\\r\\nfuture; then turning to the corporal, thanked him for his care, and\\r\\ngave him a crown to drink with his men, assuring him that the rencontre\\r\\nwas over long before he came up, and everything compromised, as he\\r\\nmight have observed by our behaviour; as a farther proof of which, he\\r\\nwould find upon examination that one of my pistols had been discharged:\\r\\nbut this civil person, without giving himself or me any farther\\r\\ntrouble, received the bounty with a thousand bows and acknowledgments,\\r\\nand, returning the pistols, released me immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not gone a hundred yards, when my friend Oregan came up in order\\r\\nto rescue me, with two tatterdemalions, whom he had engaged for that\\r\\npurpose about the purlieus of St. Gilesâ\\x80\\x99s. One of them was armed with a\\r\\nmusket that wanted a lock, and another with a rusty broadsword, but\\r\\ntheir dress surpassed all description. When he understood I was already\\r\\nfree he made an apology for his abrupt departure, and introduced me to\\r\\nhis two companions: First, to Counsellor Fitzclabber, who, he told me,\\r\\nwas then employed in compiling a history of the kings of Minster, from\\r\\nIrish manuscripts; and then to his friend Mr. Gahagan, who was a\\r\\nprofound philosopher and politician, and had projected many excellent\\r\\nschemes for the good of his country. But it seems these literati had\\r\\nbeen very ill rewarded for their ingenious labours; for, between them\\r\\nboth, there was but one shirt, and half a pair of breeches. I thanked\\r\\nthem very kindly for their readiness to assist me, and, having offered\\r\\nmy service in my turn, bade them good morrow, desiring Oregan to\\r\\naccompany me to my lodgings, where he was fitted with decent clothes\\r\\nfrom my wardrobe, so much to his satisfaction, that he swore eternal\\r\\ngratitude and friendship to me, and, at my request, recounted all the\\r\\nadventures of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, I waited on Melinda, who received me with great\\r\\nkindness and familiarity, and laughed excessively at my adventure with\\r\\nthe Irishman, to whose wishes she was no stranger, having more than a\\r\\ndozen letters in her possession, which he had written to her on the\\r\\nsubject of love, and which, for my entertainment, she submitted to my\\r\\nperusal. Having made ourselves merry at the expense of this poor\\r\\nadmirer, I seized the opportunity of her motherâ\\x80\\x99s going out of the\\r\\nroom, and introduced my own passion, which I recommended to her with\\r\\nall the ardour and eloquence I was master of. I flattered, sighed,\\r\\nswore, entreated, and acted a thousand extravagancies, in hopes of\\r\\nmaking some impression on her heart; but she heard everything I said\\r\\nwithout discovering the least emotion; and other company came in before\\r\\nshe would vouchsafe one serious reply. After tea, the cards were\\r\\nbrought in according to custom, and it was my good fortune to have\\r\\nMelinda for my partner; by which means, instead of losing, I came off\\r\\nwith five guineas clear gain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI soon became acquainted with a good many people of fashion, and spent\\r\\nmy time in the modish diversions of the town, such as plays, operas,\\r\\nmasquerades, drums, assemblies, and muppet-shows; chiefly in company\\r\\nwith Melinda, whom I cultivated with all the eagerness and address that\\r\\nmy prospect could inspire, and my education afford. I spared neither my\\r\\nperson nor my purse to gratify her vanity and pride; my rivals were\\r\\nintimidated, and indeed outshone; and, after all, I began to fear that\\r\\nthe dear creature had not a heart to lose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, finding myself unable to support the expense of this amour\\r\\nmuch longer, I was determined to bring the matter to a crisis; and one\\r\\nevening, while we were together by ourselves, complained of her\\r\\nindifference, described the tortures of suspense to a love-sick mind,\\r\\nand pressed her to disclose her sentiments of matrimony and me with\\r\\nsuch earnestness, that she could not, with all her art, shift the\\r\\nsubject, but was obliged to come to an eclaircissement. She told me,\\r\\nwith a careless air, that she had no objection to my person, and if I\\r\\ncould satisfy her mother in other particulars, I should not find her\\r\\naverse to the match; but she was resolved to do nothing in such a\\r\\nmomentous concern without the advice and consent of her parent. This\\r\\nwas no very agreeable declaration to me, whose aim had been to win her\\r\\ninclination first, and then secure my conquest by a private marriage,\\r\\nto which I flattered myself she would express no reluctance. That I\\r\\nmight not, however, desert my cause before it was desperate, I waited\\r\\non her mother; and, with great formality, demanded the daughter in\\r\\nmarriage. The good lady, who was a very notable woman, behaved with\\r\\ngreat state and civility; thanked me for the honour I intended her\\r\\nfamily; and said, she did not doubt that I was in all respects\\r\\nqualified to make a woman happy; but it concerned her as a parent\\r\\nanxious about the welfare of her child, to inquire into the particulars\\r\\nof my fortune, and know what settlement I proposed to make. To this\\r\\nintimation, which would have utterly disconcerted me if I had not\\r\\nexpected it, I replied, without hesitation that, though my fortune was\\r\\nvery small, I was a gentleman by birth and education, would maintain\\r\\nher daughter in the sphere of a gentlewoman, and settle her own dowry\\r\\non her and her heirs for ever. This careful matron did not seem to\\r\\nrelish my proposal, but observed, with a demure countenance, that there\\r\\nwas no necessity for settling that upon her child which was her own\\r\\nalready; however, if I pleased, her lawyer should confer with mine upon\\r\\nthe matter; and, in the meantime, she desired I would favour her with a\\r\\nperusal of my rent-roll. Notwithstanding the vexation I was under, I\\r\\ncould scarce forbear laughing in her face at the mention of my\\r\\nrent-roll, which was indeed a severe piece of satire upon my\\r\\npretensions. I frankly owned I had no landed estate; and told her that\\r\\nI could not exactly specify the sum I was master of, until I had\\r\\nregulated my affairs, which were at present in some disorder; but that\\r\\nI would take an opportunity of satisfying her on that head very soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long before I took my leave, and returned to my lodgings in\\r\\na very melancholy mood, persuaded that I had nothing more to expect\\r\\nfrom that quarter. I was confirmed in this opinion next day, when I\\r\\nwent back with a view of explaining myself more fully to the old\\r\\ngentlewoman; and was told by the footman that his ladies were not at\\r\\nhome, although I had seen Melinda through the blinds at a parlour\\r\\nwindow, as I went up to the door. Incensed at this affront, I quitted\\r\\nthe door without saying one word, and as I repassed the parlour, bowed\\r\\nto Miss, who still remained in the same situation, securely screened,\\r\\nas she thought, from my view.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis disappointment gave me more uneasiness on Strapâ\\x80\\x99s account than my\\r\\nown, for I was in no danger of dying for love of Melinda; on the\\r\\ncontrary, the remembrance of my charming Narcissa was a continual check\\r\\nupon my conscience during the whole course of my addresses; and perhaps\\r\\ncontributed to the bad success of my scheme, by controlling my raptures\\r\\nand condemning my design.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a necessity for informing my companion of everything that\\r\\nhappened to me and I performed this piece of duty in an affected\\r\\npassion, swearing I would be his pack-horse no longer, and desiring him\\r\\nto take the management of his affairs into his own hands. This finesse\\r\\nhad the desired effect, for, instead of grumbling over my miscarriage,\\r\\nStrap was frightened at the passion I feigned, and begged me, for the\\r\\nlove of God, to be appeased; observing that, although we had suffered a\\r\\ngreat loss, it was not irreparable; and if Fortune frowned to day, she\\r\\nmight perhaps smile to-morrow. I pretended to acquiesce in his remarks,\\r\\npraise his equanimity, and promised to improve my misfortune. He, on\\r\\nthe other hand, pretended to be perfectly well satisfied with my\\r\\nconduct, and conjured me to follow the dictates of my own reflection;\\r\\nbut, in spite of all his affectation, I could perceive his inward\\r\\naffliction, and his visage sensibly increased in longitude from that\\r\\nday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER L\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI long to be revenged on Melindaâ\\x80\\x94apply to Banter for his Assistanceâ\\x80\\x94he\\r\\ncontrives a scheme for that purposeâ\\x80\\x94which is put in Execution with\\r\\ngreat Successâ\\x80\\x94I make an Attempt upon the Heart of Miss Gripewell, but\\r\\nam disappointedâ\\x80\\x94grow melancholy at my Disappointment, and have recourse\\r\\nto the Bottleâ\\x80\\x94receive a Billet-douxâ\\x80\\x94am ravished with the Contentsâ\\x80\\x94find\\r\\nmyself involved in Intrigue, which I imagined would make my Fortuneâ\\x80\\x94am\\r\\nconfounded at my mistake, which banishes all Thoughts of Matrimony\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, my attention was wholly engrossed in search of another\\r\\nmistress, and the desire of being revenged on Melinda, in both which\\r\\nschemes I was very much assisted by Billy Chatter, who was such a\\r\\nnecessary creature among the ladies, that in all private dances he\\r\\nengaged the men. To him therefore I applied, desiring he would\\r\\nintroduce me to a partner of some figure, at the next private assembly,\\r\\nfor the sake of a frolic, the intention of which I would afterwards\\r\\ncommunicate. Billy, who had heard something of a difference between\\r\\nMelinda and me, immediately smoked part of my design, and, thinking I\\r\\nonly wanted to alarm her jealousy a little, promised to gratify my\\r\\ndesire, by matching me with a partner worth thirty thousand pounds,\\r\\nwhom the ladies of this end of the town had lately taken under their\\r\\nmanagement and protection. Upon further inquiry, I found this personâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nname was Miss Biddy Gripewell; that her father, who had been a\\r\\npawnbroker, died intestate, by which means all his substance descended\\r\\nto his daughter, who was so little a favourite that, could the old man\\r\\nhave prevailed with his own rapacious disposition to part with as much\\r\\nmoney as would have paid the expense of a will, she would not have\\r\\ninherited the sixth part of his fortune; that during his life, far from\\r\\nbeing educated in a way suitable to such great expectations, she was\\r\\nobliged to live like a servant wench, and do the most menial offices in\\r\\nthe family. But his funeral was no sooner performed, than she assumed\\r\\nthe fine lady, and found so many people of both sexes to flatter,\\r\\ncaress, and instruct her, that, for want of discretion and experience,\\r\\nshe was grown insufferably vain and arrogant, and pretended to no less\\r\\nthan a duke or earl at least for her husband; that she had the\\r\\nmisfortune to be neglected by the English quality, but a certain poor\\r\\nScottish lord was then making interest to be introduced to her\\r\\nacquaintance. In the meantime, she was fallen into the hands of a\\r\\nnotable lady, who had already disposed of her to a lieutenant of foot,\\r\\na distant relation of her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s, though Miss as yet knew nothing\\r\\nof the affair; and lastly that if I proposed to dance with her, I must\\r\\ngive him leave to represent me as a knight, or foreign count at least.\\r\\nI was ravished at this piece of information, and consented for one\\r\\nnight, to personate a French marquis, that I might the easier fulfil my\\r\\nrevenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving made the appointment with Chatter I went to Banterâ\\x80\\x99s lodgings,\\r\\nas I had by this time conceived a great opinion of his penetration and\\r\\nknowledge; and, after I had enjoined secrecy, told him every\\r\\ncircumstance of my disgrace with Melinda, and imparted the plan I had\\r\\nprojected to mortify that proud coquette, desiring his advice in\\r\\nproving, and assistance in executing the scheme. Nothing could be more\\r\\nagreeable to his misanthropical temper than an account of her behaviour\\r\\nand my resentment: he applauded my resolution, and proposed that I\\r\\nshould not only provide myself with a proper partner, but also procure\\r\\nsuch a one for Miss Goosetrap, as should infallibly entail upon her the\\r\\nridicule of all her acquaintance. For this purpose he mentioned his\\r\\nbarber who he said, was an exceeding coxcomb lately come from Paris,\\r\\nwhose absurd affectation and grimace, would easily pass upon her for\\r\\nthe sprightly politesse of a gentleman improved by travel. I hugged him\\r\\nfor this hint; and he assured me it would be no difficult matter to\\r\\nmake him believe, that Melinda, having seen him by accident, was\\r\\ncaptivated by his appearance, and begged for his acquaintance. He\\r\\nactually engaged him on this pretence, and painted his good fortune in\\r\\nsuch colours that the poor shaver was quite beside himself with joy. He\\r\\nwas immediately fitted with a tawdry suit of clothes belonging to\\r\\nBanter, and by him recommended to Chatter as a very pretty fellow, just\\r\\nreturned from his travels. Master Billy, who acted as a gentleman usher\\r\\nto a great many of the fair sex in and about town, undertook at once to\\r\\nbespeak Melinda in his behalf; and everything happened according to my\\r\\nwish.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time appointed I appeared dressed to the best advantage; and, in\\r\\nthe character of a Marquis, had the honour of opening the ball with the\\r\\nrich heiress, who attracted the eyes of the whole company by the\\r\\nprodigious number of jewels with which she was adorned. Among others I\\r\\nperceived Melinda, who could not more conceal her envy than\\r\\nastonishment at my success; her curiosity was still more flagrant and\\r\\ntormenting, for she had never seen Miss Gripewell before; and Chatter,\\r\\nwho alone could give her any satisfaction on that head, was engaged in\\r\\nconversation at the other end of the room. I observed her impatience,\\r\\nand exulted in her chagrin; and after my partner was set, took the\\r\\nopportunity of passing by her to make a slight bow without stopping,\\r\\nwhich completed my triumph and her indignation. She changed colour,\\r\\nbridled up, assumed an air of disdain, and flirted her fan with such a\\r\\nfury, that it went to pieces in a moment, to the no small entertainment\\r\\nof those who sat near and observed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the metamorphosed barber took her out, and acted his part\\r\\nwith such ridiculous extravagance that the mirth of the whole company\\r\\nwas excited at his expense, and his partner was so much ashamed that,\\r\\nbefore the country dances began, she retired in great confusion, under\\r\\npretence of being taken suddenly ill, and was followed by her gallant,\\r\\nwho no doubt imagined her indisposition was nothing but love; and laid\\r\\nhold of the occasion of conducting her home, to comfort her, with an\\r\\nassurance of his entertaining a reciprocal passion. They were no sooner\\r\\ngone than an inquisitive whisper of â\\x80\\x9cWho is he?â\\x80\\x9d ran round the room;\\r\\nand Chatter could give them no other intelligence about him than that\\r\\nhe was a man of fortune just returned from his travels. I, who alone\\r\\nwas acquainted with his real quality, affected ignorance well knowing\\r\\nthat female curiosity would not rest satisfied with such a general\\r\\naccount, and that the discovery would proceed with a better grace from\\r\\nanybody than me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, I was tempted by the richness of the prize to practise upon\\r\\nMiss Gripewellâ\\x80\\x99s heart, but soon found it too well fortified with pride\\r\\nand indifference to yield to any efforts in my own character, and I\\r\\nneither would nor could preserve the title I had borrowed longer than\\r\\nthat night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I expected, everything came to light next day. The barber, in pure\\r\\nsimplicity of heart, detected himself to Melinda, and discovered the\\r\\nfoundation of his hopes; she sickened at the affront, and was ashamed\\r\\nto show her face in public for many weeks after this accident. Poor\\r\\nChatter found it impossible to justify himself to her satisfaction; was\\r\\nin utter disgrace with Miss Gripewell, for having imposed me upon her\\r\\nas a nobleman; and suffered very much in his character and influence\\r\\namong the ladies in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding my finances diminished more than one-half, and my project as\\r\\nlittle advanced as on the first day of my arrival in town, I began to\\r\\ndespair of my success, and grew melancholy at the prospect of\\r\\napproaching want. To dispel the horrors of this fiend I had recourse to\\r\\nthe bottle, and kept more company than ever. I became particularly\\r\\nattached to the playhouse, conversed with the actors behind the scenes,\\r\\ngrew acquainted with a body of templars, and in a short time commenced\\r\\na professed wit and critic. Indeed, I may say, without vanity, that I\\r\\nwas much better qualified than any one of my companions, who were,\\r\\ngenerally speaking, of all the creatures I ever conversed with, the\\r\\nmost ignorant and assuming. By means of these avocations I got the\\r\\nbetter of care, and learned to separate my ideas in such a manner that,\\r\\nwhenever I was attacked by a gloomy reflection, I could shove it aside,\\r\\nand call in some agreeable reverie to my assistance. This was not the\\r\\ncase with Strap, who practised a thousand shifts to conceal the sorrow\\r\\nthat preyed upon his carcass, and reduced him to the resemblance of a\\r\\nmere skeleton.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I thus posted, in a thoughtless manner, towards poverty, I one\\r\\nday received, by the penny post, a letter written in a womanâ\\x80\\x99s hand,\\r\\ncontaining a great many high-flown compliments, warm protestations of\\r\\nlove, couched in a very poetical style, an earnest desire of knowing\\r\\nwhether or not my heart was engaged, by leaving an answer at a certain\\r\\nplace, directed to R. B., and the whole subscribed â\\x80\\x9cYour incognita.â\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\nwas transported with joy on reading the contents of this billet-doux,\\r\\nwhich I admired as a masterpiece of tenderness and elegance, and was\\r\\nalready up to my ears in love with the author, whom my imagination\\r\\nrepresented as a lady of fortune, in the bloom of youth and beauty.\\r\\nElevated with this conjecture, I went to work, and exhausted my\\r\\ninvention in composing an answer suitable to the sublimity of her style\\r\\nand the ardour of her sentiments. I expressed my admiration of her wit\\r\\nin terms the most hyperbolical, and while I acknowledged myself\\r\\nunworthy of her regard, declared myself enamoured of her understanding;\\r\\nand in the most pathetic manner implored the honour of an interview.\\r\\nHaving finished this performance, and communicated it to Strap, who\\r\\nskipped about for joy, I dispatched him with it to the place appointed,\\r\\nwhich was the house of a milliner not far from Bond Street, and desired\\r\\nhim to keep watch near the door for some time, that he might discover\\r\\nthe person who should call for it. In less than an hour he returned\\r\\nwith a joyful countenance, and told me that, soon after he had\\r\\ndelivered the letter, a chairman was called, to whom it was given, with\\r\\ndirections to carry it to the house of a rich gentleman in the\\r\\nneighbourhood, whither he (Strap) followed him, and saw him put it into\\r\\nthe hands of a waiting-woman, who paid the messenger, and shut the\\r\\ndoor; that, upon inquiry at an alehouse hard by, where he called for a\\r\\npint of beer, he understood the gentleman to whom the house belonged\\r\\nhad an only daughter, very handsome, who would inherit his whole\\r\\nestate; and who certainly was the author of the billet I had received.\\r\\nI was of the same opinion, and, hugging myself in the happy prospect,\\r\\ndressed immediately, and passed in great state the house that contained\\r\\nmy unknown admirer. Nor was my vanity disappointed; for I perceived a\\r\\nbeautiful young creature standing at one of the windows of the\\r\\ndining-room, who, I imagined, observed me with more than common\\r\\ncuriosity. That I might indulge her view, and at the same time feast my\\r\\nown, I affected to stop, and gave orders to Strap, in the street, just\\r\\nopposite to her station, by which means I had an opportunity of seeing\\r\\nher more distinctly, and of congratulating myself on having made a\\r\\nconquest of so much perfection. In a few moments she retired, and I\\r\\nbetook myself to the ordinary in a rapture of hope, which deprived me\\r\\nof my appetite for that meal, and sent me home in the evening to\\r\\nindulge my contemplation.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly next day, I was favoured with another epistle from my unknown\\r\\nadmirer, signifying her unutterable joy at the receipt of mine, which,\\r\\nwhile it made a tender of my heart, convinced her of the value of it.\\r\\nAbove all things, she professed her extreme pleasure in finding me so\\r\\nmuch attached to her understanding, a circumstance that not only\\r\\nflattered her in the most sensible part, but at the same time argued my\\r\\nown sagacity. As for the interview I desired, she assured me, that I\\r\\ncould not be more eager for such an occasion than she; but she must not\\r\\nonly sacrifice a little more to decorum, but be satisfied of my\\r\\nhonourable intentions, before she could grant that request. Meanwhile\\r\\nshe gave me to understand that, although she might owe some deference\\r\\nto the opinion of certain persons, she was resolved, in an affair that\\r\\nso nearly concerned her happiness, to consult her own inclination,\\r\\npreferable to the advice of the whole world; especially as she was\\r\\nurged to such condescension by no consideration of fortune, what she\\r\\ndepended upon being her own without restriction or control. Struck with\\r\\nadmiration at the philosophy and self-denial of my mistress, who seemed\\r\\ninsensible of the beauty she possessed, and in particular ravished with\\r\\nthat piece of intelligence by which I learned her fortune was\\r\\nindependent; I resumed the pen, launched out into encomiums on the\\r\\ndignity of her sentiments, affected to undervalue the charms of\\r\\nexternal beauty, pretended to ground my passion on the qualities of her\\r\\nmind, complained of her rigour in sacrificing my repose to an\\r\\noverscrupulous regard to decorum, and declared the purity of my designs\\r\\nin the most solemn and pathetic vows. This performance being sealed and\\r\\ndirected, was sent to the place appointed by Strap, who, that we might\\r\\nbe still the more confirmed in our belief, renewed his watch, and in a\\r\\nlittle time brought back the same information as before, with this\\r\\naddition, that Miss Sparkle (the name of my correspondent), looking out\\r\\nat the window, no sooner saw the messenger arrive, than she shut the\\r\\ncasement in a sort of beautiful confusion, and disappeared, eager no\\r\\ndoubt to hear from the dear object of her love.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy doubts now vanished, the long-expected port appeared, and I looked\\r\\nupon myself as perfectly secure of that happiness I had been in quest\\r\\nof so long. After dinner, I sauntered in company with Dr. Wagtail, to\\r\\nthat part of the town in which my inamorata lived; and, as he was a\\r\\nmere register, inquired of him into the name, character, and fortune of\\r\\neverybody who possessed a good house in the streets through which we\\r\\npassed. When it came to his turn to mention Sir John Sparkle, he\\r\\nrepresented him as a man of an immense estate and narrow disposition,\\r\\nwho mewed up his only child, a fine young lady, from the conversation\\r\\nof mankind, under the strict watch and inspection of an old governante,\\r\\nwho was either so honest, envious, or insatiable, that nobody had been\\r\\nas yet able to make her a friend, or get access to her charge, though\\r\\nnumbers attempted it every day; not so much on account of her\\r\\nexpectations from her father, who, being a widower, might marry again\\r\\nand have sons, as for a fortune of twelve thousand pounds left her by\\r\\nan uncle, of which she could not be deprived. This piece of news,\\r\\nexactly tallying with the last part of the letter I had been honoured\\r\\nwith in the morning, had such an effect on me, that any man except\\r\\nWagtail might have observed my emotion; but his attention was too much\\r\\nengrossed by the contemplation of his own importance to suffer him to\\r\\nbe affected with the deportment of any other body, unless it happened\\r\\nto be so particular that he could not help taking notice of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had disengaged myself from him, whose conversation grew insipid\\r\\nto me, I went home, and made Strap acquainted with the fruit of my\\r\\nresearches. This faithful squire was almost choked with transport, and\\r\\neven wept with joy; but whether on account of himself or me, I shall\\r\\nnot pretend to determine. Next day a third billet-doux was brought to\\r\\nme, containing many expressions of tenderness, mingled with some\\r\\naffecting doubts about the artifice of man, the inconstancy of youth,\\r\\nand the jealousy often attending the most sincere passion; withal\\r\\ndesiring I would excuse her, if she should try me a little longer,\\r\\nbefore she declared herself beyond the power of retracting. These\\r\\ninteresting scruples added fuel to my flame and impatience to my hope;\\r\\nI redoubled my complaints of her indifference, and pressed her to an\\r\\nassignation with such fervent entreaties, that in a few days she\\r\\nconsented to meet me at the house of that milliner who had forwarded\\r\\nall my letters. During the interval between the date of her promise and\\r\\nthe hour of appointment, my pride soared beyond all reason and\\r\\ndescription; I lost all remembrance of the gentle Narcissa, and my\\r\\nthoughts were wholly employed in planning triumphs over the malice and\\r\\ncontempt of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the happy hour arrived. I flew to the place of rendezvous,\\r\\nand was conducted into an apartment, where I had not waited ten\\r\\nminutes, when I heard the rustling of silk, and the sound of feet\\r\\nascending the stairs; my heart took the alarm, and beat quick; my\\r\\ncheeks glowed, my nerves thrilled, and my knees shook with ecstacy! I\\r\\nperceived the door opening, saw a gold brocade petticoat advance, and\\r\\nsprang forward to embrace my charmer. Heaven and earth! how shall I\\r\\npaint my situation, when I found Miss Sparkle converted into a wrinkled\\r\\nhag turned of seventy! I was struck dumb with amazement, and petrified\\r\\nwith horror! This ancient Urganda, perceived my disorder, and,\\r\\napproaching with a languishing air, seized my hand, asking in a\\r\\nsqueaking tone, if I was indisposed. Her monstrous affectation\\r\\ncompleted the disgust I had conceived for her at her first appearance,\\r\\nand it was a long time before I could command myself so much as to\\r\\nbehave with common civility: at length, however, I recollected myself,\\r\\nand pronounced an apology for my behaviour, which I said proceeded from\\r\\na dizziness that seized me all of a sudden. My hoary Dulcinea, who, no\\r\\ndoubt, had been alarmed at my confusion, no sooner learned the cause to\\r\\nwhich I now ascribed it, than she discovered her joy in a thousand\\r\\namorous coquetries, and assumed the sprightly airs of a girl of\\r\\nsixteen. One while she ogled me with her dim eyes, quenched in rheum;\\r\\nthen, as if she was ashamed of that freedom, she affected to look down,\\r\\nblush, and play with her fan; then toss her head that I might not\\r\\nperceive a palsy that shook it, ask some childish questions with a\\r\\nlisping accent, giggle and grin with her mouth shut to conceal the\\r\\nravage of time upon her teeth, leer upon me again, sigh piteously,\\r\\nfling herself about in her chair to show her agility, and act a great\\r\\nmany more absurdities that youth and beauty can alone excuse. Shocked\\r\\nas I was at my disappointment, my disposition was incapable of\\r\\naffronting any person who loved me; I therefore endeavoured to put a\\r\\ngood face to the matter for the present, resolved to drop the whole\\r\\naffair as soon as I should get clear of her company; with this view, I\\r\\nuttered some civil things, and in particular desired to know the name\\r\\nand condition of the lady who had honoured me so much. She told me her\\r\\nname was Withers, that she lived with Sir John Sparkle in quality of\\r\\ngoverness to his only daughter, in which situation she had picked up a\\r\\ncomfortable sufficiency to make her easy for life; that she had the\\r\\npleasure of seeing me at church, where my appearance and deportment\\r\\nmade such an impression upon her heart, that she could enjoy no ease\\r\\nuntil she had inquired into my character, which she found so amiable in\\r\\nall respects, that she yielded to the violence of her inclination, and\\r\\nventured to declare her passion with too little regard perhaps to the\\r\\ndecorum of her sex; but she hoped I would forgive a trespass of which I\\r\\nmyself was in some measure the cause, and impute her intrusion to the\\r\\nirresistible dictates of love. No decayed rake ever swallowed a bolus\\r\\nwith more reluctance than I felt in making a reply suitable to this\\r\\ncompliment, when, instead of the jewel, I found the crazy casket only\\r\\nin my power; and yet my hopes began to revive a little, when I\\r\\nconsidered, that, by carrying on the appearance of an intrigue with the\\r\\nduenna, I might possibly obtain access to her charge. Encouraged by\\r\\nthis suggestion, my temper grew more serene, my reserve wore off, I\\r\\ntalked en cavalier, and even made love to this antiquated coquette, who\\r\\nseemed extremely happy in her adorer, and spread all her allurements to\\r\\nmake her imagined conquest more secure. The good woman of the house\\r\\ntreated us with tea and sweetmeats, and afterwards withdrew, like a\\r\\ncivil experienced matron as she was.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeft thus to our mutual endearments, Miss Withers (for she was still a\\r\\nmaiden) began to talk of matrimony, and expressed so much impatience in\\r\\nall her behaviour that, had she been fifty years younger, I might\\r\\npossibly have gratified her longing without having recourse to the\\r\\nchurch; but this step my virtue as well as interest forbade. When the\\r\\ninclinations of an old maid settle upon a young fellow, he is\\r\\npersecuted with her addresses; but, should he once grant her the\\r\\nfavour, he will never be able to disentangle himself from her\\r\\nimportunities and reproaches. It was my business to defer the ceremony\\r\\nas long as possible, under the most specious pretences, with a view of\\r\\nbecoming acquainted with Miss Sparkle in the meantime; and I did not\\r\\ndespair of success, when I considered, that in the course of our\\r\\ncorrespondence, I should, in all probability, be invited to visit my\\r\\nmistress in her own apartment, and by these means have an opportunity\\r\\nof conversing with her charming ward. Pleased with this prospect, my\\r\\nheart dilated with joy; I talked in raptures to the state governante,\\r\\nand kissed her shrivelled hand with great devotion, She was so much\\r\\ntransported with her good fortune, that she could not contain her\\r\\necstacy, but flew upon me like a tigress, and pressed her skinny lips\\r\\nto mine; when (as it was no doubt concerted by her evil genius) a dose\\r\\nof garlic she had swallowed that morning, to dispel wind, I suppose,\\r\\nbegan to operate with such a sudden explosion, that human nature,\\r\\ncircumstanced as I was, could not endure the shock with any degree of\\r\\ntemper. I lost all patience and reflection, flung away from her in an\\r\\ninstant, snatched my hat and cane, and ran downstairs as if the devil\\r\\nhad me in pursuit, and could scarcely retain the convulsion of my\\r\\nbowels, which were grievously offended by the perfume that assaulted\\r\\nme. Strap, who waited my return with impatience, seeing me arrive in\\r\\nthe utmost disorder, stood motionless with apprehension, and durst not\\r\\ninquire into the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I had washed my mouth, more than once, and recruited my spirits\\r\\nwith a glass of wine, I recounted to him every particular of what had\\r\\nhappened; to which he made no other reply for some time than lifting up\\r\\nhis eyes, clasping his hands, and uttering a hollow groan. At length he\\r\\nobserved, in a melancholy tone, that it was a thousand pities my organs\\r\\nwere so delicate as to be offended with the smell of garlic. â\\x80\\x9cAh! God\\r\\nhelp us,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99tis not the steams of garlic, no, nor of something\\r\\nelse, that would give me the least uneasinessâ\\x80\\x94see what it is to be a\\r\\ncoblerâ\\x80\\x99s son!â\\x80\\x9d I replied hastily, â\\x80\\x9cI wish then you would go and\\r\\nretrieve my miscarriage.â\\x80\\x9d At this suggestion he started, forced a\\r\\nsmile, and left the room, shaking his head. Whether the old gentlewoman\\r\\nresented my abrupt departure so much that her love changed into\\r\\ndisdain, or was ashamed to see me on account of her infirmity, I know\\r\\nnot; but I was never troubled again with her passion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI cultivate an Acquaintance with two Noblemenâ\\x80\\x94am introduced to earl\\r\\nStrutwellâ\\x80\\x94his kind Promise and Invitationâ\\x80\\x94the Behaviour of his Porter\\r\\nand Lacqueyâ\\x80\\x94he receives me with an Appearance of uncommon\\r\\nAffectionâ\\x80\\x94undertakes to speak in my Behalf to the Ministerâ\\x80\\x94informs me\\r\\nof his Success, and wishes me Joyâ\\x80\\x94introduces a Conversation about\\r\\nPetronius Arbiterâ\\x80\\x94falls in Love with my Watch, which I press upon himâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nmake a present of a Diamond Ring to Lord Straddleâ\\x80\\x94impart my good\\r\\nFortune to Strap and Banter, who disabuses me, to my utter\\r\\nMortification\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaffled hitherto in my matrimonial schemes, I began to question my\\r\\ntalents for the science of fortune-hunting, and to bend my thoughts\\r\\ntowards some employment under the government. With the view of\\r\\nprocuring which, I cultivated the acquaintance of Lords Straddle and\\r\\nSwillpot, whose fathers were men of interest at court. I found these\\r\\nyoung noblemen as open to my advances as I could desire; I accompanied\\r\\nthem in their midnight rambles, and often dined with them at taverns,\\r\\nwhere I had the honour of paying the reckoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nI one day took the opportunity, while I was loaded with protestations\\r\\nof friendship, to disclose my desire of being settled in some sinecure,\\r\\nand to solicit their influence in my behalf. Swillpot, squeezing my\\r\\nhand, said, I might depend upon his service by Gâ\\x80\\x94. The other swore that\\r\\nno man would be more proud than he to run my errands. Encouraged by\\r\\nthese declarations, I ventured to express an inclination to be\\r\\nintroduced to their fathers, who were able to do my business at once.\\r\\nSwillpot frankly owned he had not spoken to his father these three\\r\\nyears; and Straddle assured me, his father, having lately disobliged\\r\\nthe minister by subscribing his name to a protest in the house of\\r\\npeers, was thereby rendered incapable of serving his friends at\\r\\npresent; but he undertook to make me acquainted with Earl Strutwell,\\r\\nwho was hand and glove with a certain person who ruled the roast. This\\r\\noffer I embraced with many acknowledgments, and plied him so closely,\\r\\nin spite of a thousand evasions, that he found himself under a\\r\\nnecessity of keeping his word, and actually carried me to the levee of\\r\\nthis great man, where he left me in a crowd of fellow-dependents, and\\r\\nwas ushered to a particular closet audience; from whence, in a few\\r\\nminutes, he returned with his lordship, who took me by the hand,\\r\\nassured me he would do me all the service he could, and desired to see\\r\\nme often. I was charmed with my reception, and, although I had heard\\r\\nthat a courtierâ\\x80\\x99s promise is not to be depended upon, I thought I\\r\\ndiscovered so much sweetness of temper and candour in this earlâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncountenance, that I did not doubt of finding my account in his\\r\\nprotection. I resolved therefore to profit by this permission, and\\r\\nwaited on him next audience day, when I was favoured with a particular\\r\\nsmile, squeeze of the hand, and a whisper, signifying that he wanted\\r\\nhalf-an-hourâ\\x80\\x99s conversation with me in private, when he should be\\r\\ndisengaged, and for that purpose desired me to come and drink a dish of\\r\\nchocolate with him to-morrow morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis invitation, which did not a little flatter my vanity and\\r\\nexpectation, I took care to observe, and went to his lordshipâ\\x80\\x99s house\\r\\nat the time appointed. Having rapped at the gate, the porter unbolted\\r\\nand kept it half open, placing himself in the gap, like soldiers in the\\r\\nbroach, to dispute my passage. I asked if his lord was stirring? He\\r\\nanswered with a surly aspect, â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAt what hour does he commonly\\r\\nrise?â\\x80\\x9d said I. â\\x80\\x9cSometimes sooner, sometimes later,â\\x80\\x9d said he, closing\\r\\nthe door upon me by degrees. I then told him I was come by his\\r\\nlordshipâ\\x80\\x99s own appointment, to which intimation this Cerberus replied,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have received no orders about the matter,â\\x80\\x9d and was upon the point of\\r\\nshutting me out, when I recollected myself all of a sudden, and\\r\\nslipping a crown into his hand, begged as a favour that he would\\r\\ninquire, and let me know whether or not the earl was up. The grim\\r\\njanitor relented at the touch of my money, which he took with all the\\r\\nindifference of a taxgatherer, and showed me into a parlour, where, he\\r\\nsaid, I might amuse myself till such time as his lord should be awake.\\r\\nI had not sat ten minutes in this place, when a footman entered, and,\\r\\nwithout speaking, started at me; I interpreted this piece of his\\r\\nbehaviour into, â\\x80\\x9cPray, sir, what is your business?â\\x80\\x9d and asked the same\\r\\nquestion I had put to the porter, when I accosted him first. The\\r\\nlacquey made the same reply, and disappeared before I could get any\\r\\nfurther intelligence. In a little time he returned, on pretence of\\r\\npoking the fire, and looked at me again with great earnestness; upon\\r\\nwhich I began to perceive his meaning, and, tipping him with\\r\\nhalf-a-crown, desired he would be so good as to fall upon some method\\r\\nof letting the earl know that I was in the house. He made a low bow,\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x9cYes, sir,â\\x80\\x9d and vanished. This bounty was not thrown away, for in\\r\\nan instant he came back, and conducted me to a chamber, where I was\\r\\nreceived with great kindness and familiarity by his lordship, whom I\\r\\nfound just risen, in his morning-gown, and slippers. After breakfast,\\r\\nhe entered into a particular conversation with me about my travels, the\\r\\nremarks I had made abroad, and examined me to the full extent of my\\r\\nunderstanding. My answers seemed to please him very much, he frequently\\r\\nsqueezed my hand, and, looking at me with a singular complacency in his\\r\\ncountenance, bade me depend upon his good offices with the ministry in\\r\\nmy behalf. â\\x80\\x9cYoung men of your qualifications,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cought to be\\r\\ncherished by every administration. For my own part, I see so little\\r\\nmerit in the world, that I have laid it down as a maxim, to encourage\\r\\nthe least appearance of genius and virtue to the utmost of my power:\\r\\nyou have a great deal of both; and will not fail of making a figure one\\r\\nday, if I am not mistaken; but you must lay your account with mounting\\r\\nby gradual steps to the summit of your fortune. Rome was not built in a\\r\\nday. As you understand the languages perfectly well, how would you like\\r\\nto cross the sea as secretary to an embassy?â\\x80\\x9d I assured his lordship,\\r\\nwith great eagerness, that nothing could be more agreeable to my\\r\\ninclination: upon which he bade me make myself easy, my business was\\r\\ndone, for he had a place of that kind in his view. This piece of\\r\\ngenerosity affected me so much, that I was unable for some time to\\r\\nexpress my gratitude, which at length broke out in acknowledgments of\\r\\nmy own unworthiness, and encomiums on his benevolence. I could not even\\r\\nhelp shedding tears at the goodness of this noble lord, who no sooner\\r\\nperceived them than he caught me in his arms, and hugged and kissed me\\r\\nwith a seemingly paternal affection. Confounded at this uncommon\\r\\ninstance of fondness for a stranger, I remained a few moments silent\\r\\nand ashamed; then rose and took my leave, after he had assured me that\\r\\nhe would speak to the minister in my favour that very day; and desired\\r\\nthat I would not for the future give myself the trouble of attending at\\r\\nhis levee, but come at the same hour every day, when he should be at\\r\\nleisure, that is, three times a week.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough my hopes were now very sanguine, I determined to conceal my\\r\\nprospect from everybody, even from Strap, until I should be more\\r\\ncertain of success: and in the meantime give my patron no respite from\\r\\nmy solicitations. When I renewed my visit, I found the street-door\\r\\nopened to me as if by enchantment; but in my passage towards the\\r\\npresence-room, I was met by the valet-de-chambre, who cast some furious\\r\\nlooks at me the meaning of which I could not comprehend. The earl\\r\\nsaluted me at entrance with a tender embrace, and wished me joy of his\\r\\nsuccess with the Premier, who, he said, had preferred his\\r\\nrecommendation to that of two other noblemen very urgent in behalf of\\r\\ntheir respective friends, and absolutely promised that I should go to a\\r\\ncertain foreign court in quality of secretary to an ambassador and\\r\\nplenipotentiary who was to set out in a few weeks an affair of vast\\r\\nimportance to the nation. I was thunderstruck with my good fortune, and\\r\\ncould make no other reply than kneel and attempt to kiss my\\r\\nbenefactorâ\\x80\\x99s hand, which submission he would not permit; but, raising\\r\\nme up, pressed me to his breast with surprising emotion, and told me he\\r\\nhad now taken upon himself the care of making my fortune. What enhanced\\r\\nthe value of the benefit still the more, was his making light of the\\r\\nfavour, and shifting the conversation to another subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong other topics of discourse, that of the Belles Lettres was\\r\\nintroduced, upon which his lordship held forth with great taste and\\r\\nerudition and discovered an intimate knowledge of the authors of\\r\\nantiquity, â\\x80\\x9cHereâ\\x80\\x99s a book,â\\x80\\x9d said he, taking one from his bosom,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwritten with great elegance and spirit; and, though the subject may\\r\\ngive offence to some narrow-minded people, the author will always be\\r\\nheld in esteem by every person of wit and learning.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he put\\r\\ninto my hand Petronius Arbiter, and asked my opinion of his wit and\\r\\nmanner. I told him, that, in my opinion, he wrote with great ease and\\r\\nvivacity, but was withal so lewd and indecent that he ought to find no\\r\\nquarter or protection among people of morals and taste. â\\x80\\x9cI own,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nreplied the earl, â\\x80\\x9cthat his taste in love is generally decried, and\\r\\nindeed condemned by our laws; but perhaps that may be more owing to\\r\\nprejudice and misapprehension than to true reason and deliberation. The\\r\\nbest man among the ancients is said to have entertained that passion;\\r\\none of the wisest of their legislators has permitted the indulgence of\\r\\nit in his commonwealth; the most celebrated poets have not scrupled to\\r\\navow it. At this day it prevails not only over all the East, but in\\r\\nmost parts of Europe; in our own country, it gains ground apace, and in\\r\\nall probability will become in a short time a more, fashionable vice\\r\\nthan simple fornication. Indeed there is something to be said in\\r\\nvindication of it; for, notwithstanding the severity of the law against\\r\\noffenders in this way, it must be confessed that the practice of this\\r\\npassion is unattended with that curse and burthen upon society which\\r\\nproceeds from a race of miserable and deserted bastards, who are either\\r\\nmurdered by their parents, deserted to the utmost want and\\r\\nwretchedness, or bred up to prey upon the commonwealth: and it likewise\\r\\nprevents the debauchery of many a young maiden, and the prostitution of\\r\\nhonest menâ\\x80\\x99s wives; not to mention the consideration of health, which\\r\\nis much less liable to be impaired in the gratification of this\\r\\nappetite, than in the exercise of common venery, which, by ruining the\\r\\nconstitutions of our young men, has produced a puny progeny that\\r\\ndegenerates from generation to generation. Nay, I have been told, that\\r\\nthere is another motive perhaps more powerful than all these, that\\r\\ninduces people to cultivate this inclination; namely, the exquisite\\r\\npleasure attending its success.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this discourse I began to be apprehensive that his lordship,\\r\\nfinding I had travelled, was afraid I might have been infected with\\r\\nthis spurious and sordid desire abroad, and took this method of\\r\\nsounding my sentiments on the subject. Fired at this supposed\\r\\nsuspicion, I argued against it with great warmth, as an appetite\\r\\nunnatural, absurd, and of pernicious consequence; and declared my utter\\r\\ndetestation and abhorrence of it in these lines of the satirist:â\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\nEternal infamy the wretch confound\\r\\nWho planted first that vice on British ground!\\r\\nA vice! That spite of nature and sense reigns,\\r\\nAnd poisons genial love, and manhood stains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earl smiled at my indignation, and told me he was glad to find my\\r\\nopinion of the matter so conformable to his own, and that what he had\\r\\nadvanced was only to provoke me to an answer, with which he professed\\r\\nhimself perfectly well pleased. After I had enjoyed a long audience, I\\r\\nhappened to look at my watch, in order to regulate my motions by it;\\r\\nand his lordship, observing the chased case, desired to see the device,\\r\\nand examine the exception, which he approved with some expressions of\\r\\nadmiration. Considering the obligations I lay under to his lordship, I\\r\\nthought there could not be a fitter opportunity than the present to\\r\\nmanifest, in some shape, my gratitude; I therefore begged he would do\\r\\nme the honour to accept of the watch as a small testimony of the sense\\r\\nI had of his lordshipâ\\x80\\x99s generosity; but, he refused it in a peremptory\\r\\nmanner, and said he was sorry I should entertain such a mercenary\\r\\nopinion of him; observing at the same time, that it was the most\\r\\nbeautiful piece of workmanship he had ever seen, and desiring to know\\r\\nwhere he could have such another. I begged a thousand pardons for the\\r\\nfreedom I had taken, which I hoped he would impute to nothing else than\\r\\nthe highest veneration for his personâ\\x80\\x94told him, that, as it came to my\\r\\nhand by accident in France, I could give him no information about the\\r\\nmaker, for there was no name on the inside; and once more humbly\\r\\nentreated that he would indulge me so far as to use it for my sake. He\\r\\nwas still positive in refusing it; but was pleased to thank me for my\\r\\ngenerous offer, saying, it was a present that no nobleman need be\\r\\nashamed of receiving: though he was resolved to show his\\r\\ndisinterestedness with regard to me, for whom he had conceived a\\r\\nparticular friendship; and insisted (if I were willing to part with the\\r\\nwatch) upon knowing what it had cost, that he might at least indemnify\\r\\nme, by refunding the money. On the other hand, I assured his lordship\\r\\nthat I should look upon it as an uncommon mark of distinction, if he\\r\\nwould take it without further question; and, rather than disoblige me,\\r\\nhe was at last persuaded to put it in his pocket, to my no small\\r\\nsatisfaction, who took my leave immediately, after having received a\\r\\nkind squeeze, and an injunction to depend upon his promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuoyed up with this reception, my heart opened; I gave away a guinea,\\r\\namong the lacqueys, who escorted me to the door, flew to the lodgings\\r\\nof Lord Straddle, upon whom I forced my diamond ring as an\\r\\nacknowledgment for the great service he had done me, and from thence\\r\\nhied me home, with an intent of sharing my happiness with honest Strap.\\r\\nI determined, however, to heighten his pleasure, by depressing his\\r\\nspirits at first, and then bringing in good news with double relish.\\r\\nFor this purpose, I affected the appearance of disappointment and\\r\\nchagrin, and told him in an abrupt manner that I had lost the watch and\\r\\ndiamond. Poor Hugh, who had been already harassed into a consumption by\\r\\nintelligence of this sort, no sooner heard these words, than, unable to\\r\\ncontain himself, he cried, with distraction in his looks, â\\x80\\x9cGod in\\r\\nheaven forbid!â\\x80\\x9d I could carry on the farce no longer; but, laughing in\\r\\nhis face, told him everything that had passed, as above recited. His\\r\\nfeatures were immediately unbended, and the transition was so\\r\\naffecting, that he wept with joy, calling my Lord Strutwell by the\\r\\nappellations of Jewel, Phoenix, Rara avis; and praising God, that there\\r\\nwas still some virtue left among our nobility. Our mutual\\r\\ncongratulations being over, we gave way to our imagination, and\\r\\nanticipated our happiness by prosecuting our success through the\\r\\ndifferent steps of promotion, till I arrived at the rank of a prime\\r\\nminister, and he to that of my first secretary.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntoxicated with these ideas, I went to the ordinary, where, meeting\\r\\nwith Banter, I communicated the whole affair in confidence to him,\\r\\nconcluding with an assurance that I would do him all the service in my\\r\\npower. He heard me to an end with great patience, then regarding me a\\r\\ngood while with a look of disdain, pronounced, â\\x80\\x9cSo your business is\\r\\ndone, you think?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cAs good as done. I believe,â\\x80\\x9d said I. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell\\r\\nyou,â\\x80\\x9d replied he, â\\x80\\x9cwhat will do it still more effectuallyâ\\x80\\x94a halter!\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x99Sdeath! if I had been such a gull to two such scoundrels as Strutwell\\r\\nand Straddle, I would, without any more ado, tuck myself up.â\\x80\\x9d Shocked\\r\\nat this exclamation, I desired him with some confusion to explain\\r\\nhimself; upon which he gave me to understand that Straddle was a poor\\r\\ncontemptible wretch, who lived by borrowing and pimping for his\\r\\nfellow-peers; that in consequence of this last capacity, he had\\r\\ndoubtless introduced me to Strutwell, who was so notorious for a\\r\\npassion for his own sex that he was amazed his character had never\\r\\nreached my ears; and that, far from being able to obtain for me the\\r\\npost he had promised, his interest at court was so low, that he could\\r\\nscarce provide for a superannuated footman once a year in the customs\\r\\nor excise; that it was a common thing for him to amuse strangers, whom\\r\\nhis jackals ran down, with such assurances and caresses as he had\\r\\nbestowed on me, until he had stripped them of their cash, and\\r\\neverything valuable about them, very often of their chastity, and then\\r\\nleave them a prey to want and infamy: that he allowed his servants no\\r\\nother wages than that part of the spoil which they could glean by their\\r\\nindustry; and the whole of his conduct towards me was so glaring, that\\r\\nnobody who knew anything of mankind could have been imposed upon by his\\r\\ninsinuations.\\r\\n\\r\\nI leave the reader to judge how I relished this piece of information,\\r\\nwhich precipitated me from the most exalted pinnacle of hope to the\\r\\nlowest abyss of despondence, and well nigh determined me to take\\r\\nBanterâ\\x80\\x99s advice and finish my chagrin with a halter. I had no room to\\r\\nsuspect the veracity of my friend, because, upon recollection, I found\\r\\nevery circumstance of Strutwellâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour exactly tallying with the\\r\\ncharacter he had described; his hugs, embraces, squeezes, and eager\\r\\nlooks, were now no longer a mystery; no more than his defence of\\r\\nPetronius, and the jealous frown of his valet-de-chambre, who, it\\r\\nseems, had been the favourite pathic of his lord.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI attempt to recover my Watch and Jewel, but to no Purposeâ\\x80\\x94resolve to\\r\\nrevenge myself on Strutwell by my Importunityâ\\x80\\x94am reduced to my last\\r\\nGuineaâ\\x80\\x94obliged to inform Strap of my Necessity, who is almost\\r\\ndistracted with the News, but nevertheless obliged to pawn my best\\r\\nSword for present Subsistenceâ\\x80\\x94that small Supply being exhausted, I am\\r\\nalmost stupified with my Misfortunesâ\\x80\\x94go to the Gaming Table by the\\r\\nAdvice of Banter, and come off with unexpected Successâ\\x80\\x94Strapâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nEcstacyâ\\x80\\x94Mrs. Gawky waits upon me, professes Remorse for her Perfidy,\\r\\nand implores my Assistanceâ\\x80\\x94I do myself a Piece of Justice by her Means,\\r\\nand afterwards reconcile her to her Father\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so confounded that I could make no reply to Banter, who\\r\\nreproached me with great indignation for having thrown away upon\\r\\nrascals that which, had it been converted into ready money, would have\\r\\nsupported the rank of a gentleman for some months, and enabled me, at\\r\\nthe same time, to oblige my friends. Stupified as I was, I could easily\\r\\ndivine the source of his concern, but sneaked away in a solitary\\r\\nmanner, without yielding the least answer to his expostulations; and\\r\\nbegan to deliberate within myself in what manner I should attempt to\\r\\nretrieve the movables I had so foolishly lost. I should have thought it\\r\\nno robbery to take them again by force, could I have done it without\\r\\nany danger of being detected; but, as I could have no such opportunity,\\r\\nI resolved to work by finesse, and go immediately to the lodgings of\\r\\nStraddle, where I was so fortunate as to find him. â\\x80\\x9cMy Lord,â\\x80\\x9d said I,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have just now recollected, that the diamond I had the honour of\\r\\npresenting to you is loosened a little in the socket, and there is a\\r\\nyoung fellow just arrived from Paris, who is reckoned the best jeweller\\r\\nin Europe; I knew him in France; and, if your lordship will give me\\r\\nleave, will carry the ring to him to be set to rights.â\\x80\\x9d His lordship\\r\\nwas not to be caught in this snare; he thanked me for my offer, and\\r\\ntold me, that, having himself observed the defect, he had sent it to\\r\\nhis own jeweller to be mended; and, indeed, by this time I believe it\\r\\nwas in the jewellerâ\\x80\\x99s hands, though not in order to be mended, for it\\r\\nstood in need of no alteration.\\r\\n\\r\\nBalked in this piece of politics, I cursed my simplicity; but resolved\\r\\nto play a surer game with the earl, which I thus devised. I did not\\r\\ndoubt of being admitted into familiar conversation with him, as before,\\r\\nand hoped by some means to get the watch into my hand; then, on\\r\\npretence of winding or playing with it, drop it on the floor, when, in\\r\\nall probability, the fall would disorder the work so as to stop its\\r\\nmotion; this event would furnish me with an opportunity of insisting\\r\\nupon carrying it away in order to be repaired, and then I should be in\\r\\nno hurry to bring it back. What pity it was I could not find an\\r\\noccasion of putting this fine scheme in execution! When I went to renew\\r\\nmy visit to his lordship, my access to the parlour was as free as ever;\\r\\nbut after I had waited for some time, the valet-de-chambre came in with\\r\\nhis lordâ\\x80\\x99s compliments, and a desire to see me to-morrow at his levee,\\r\\nhe being at present so much indisposed that he could not see company. I\\r\\ninterpreted this message into a bad omen, and came away muttering\\r\\ncurses against his lordshipâ\\x80\\x99s politeness, and ready to go to\\r\\nloggerheads with myself for being so egregiously duped. But, that I\\r\\nmight have some satisfaction for the loss I had sustained, I besieged\\r\\nhim so closely at his levee, and persecuted him with my solicitations;\\r\\nnot without faint hopes, indeed, of reaping something more from my\\r\\nindustry than the bare pleasure of making him uneasy; though I could\\r\\nnever obtain another private hearing the whole course of my attendance;\\r\\nneither had I resolution enough to undeceive Strap, whose looks in a\\r\\nlittle time were so whetted with impatience, that whenever I came home,\\r\\nhis eyes devoured me, as it were, with eagerness of attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, finding myself reduced to my last guinea, I was\\r\\ncompelled to disclose my necessity, though I endeavoured to sweeten the\\r\\ndiscovery by rehearsing to him the daily assurances I received from my\\r\\npatron. But these promises were not of efficacy sufficient to support\\r\\nthe spirits of my friend, who no sooner understood the lowness of my\\r\\nfinances, than, uttering a dreadful groan, he exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cIn the name\\r\\nof God, what shall we do?â\\x80\\x9d In order to comfort him, I said, that many\\r\\nof my acquaintances, who were in a worse condition than we, supported,\\r\\nnotwithstanding, the character of gentlemen; and advising him to thank\\r\\nGod that as yet we had incurred no debt, proposed he should pawn my\\r\\nsword of steel, inlaid with gold, and trust to my discretion for the\\r\\nrest. This expedient was wormwood and gall to poor Strap, who, in spite\\r\\nof his invincible affection for me, still retained notions of economy\\r\\nand expense suitable to the narrowness of his education; nevertheless\\r\\nhe complied with my request, and raised seven pieces on the sword in a\\r\\ntwinkling. This supply, inconsiderable as it was, made me as happy for\\r\\nthe present, as if I had kept five hundred pounds in bank; for by this\\r\\ntime I was so well skilled in procrastinating every troublesome\\r\\nreflection, that the prospect of want seldom affected me very much, let\\r\\nit be ever so near. And now indeed it was nearer than I imagined. My\\r\\nlandlord, having occasion for money, put me in mind of my being\\r\\nindebted to him five guineas in lodging; and, telling me he had a sum\\r\\nto make up, begged I would excuse his importunity, and discharge the\\r\\ndebt. Though I could ill spare so much cash, my pride took the\\r\\nresolution of disbursing it. This I did in a cavalier manner, after he\\r\\nhad written a discharge, telling him with an air of scorn and\\r\\nresentment, I saw he was resolved that I should not be long in his\\r\\nbooks; while Strap, who stood by, and knew my circumstances, wrung his\\r\\nhands in secret, gnawed his nether lip, and turned yellow with despair.\\r\\nWhatever appearance of indifference my vanity enabled me to put on, I\\r\\nwas thunderstruck with this demand, which I had no sooner satisfied,\\r\\nthan I hastened into company, with a view of beguiling my cares with\\r\\nconversation, or drowning them with wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner, a party was accordingly made in the coffee-house, from\\r\\nwhence we adjourned to the tavern, where, instead of sharing the mirth\\r\\nof the company, I was as much chagrined at their good humour as a\\r\\ndamned soul in hell would be at a glimpse of heaven. In vain did I\\r\\nswallow bumper after bumper! the wine had lost its effect upon me, and,\\r\\nfar from raising my dejected spirits, could not even lay me asleep.\\r\\nBanter, who was the only intimate I had (Strap excepted), perceived my\\r\\nanxiety, and, when we broke up, reproached me with pusillanimity, for\\r\\nbeing cast down at my disappointment that such a rascal as Strutwell\\r\\ncould be the occasion of. I told him I did not at all see how\\r\\nStrutwellâ\\x80\\x99s being a rascal alleviated my misfortune; and gave him to\\r\\nunderstand that my present grief did not so much proceed from that\\r\\ndisappointment, as from the low ebb of my fortune, which was sunk to\\r\\nsomething less than two guineas. At this declaration he cried, â\\x80\\x9cPsha!\\r\\nis that all?â\\x80\\x9d and assured me there were a thousand ways of living in\\r\\ntown without a fortune, he himself having subsisted many years entirely\\r\\nby his wit. I expressed an eager desire of being acquainted with some\\r\\nof these methods, and he, without farther expostulation, bade me follow\\r\\nhim. He conducted me to a house under the piazzas in Covert Garden,\\r\\nwhich we entered, and having delivered our swords to a grim fellow who\\r\\ndemanded them at the foot of the staircase, ascended to the second\\r\\nstory, where I saw multitudes of people standing round two\\r\\ngaming-tables, loaded, in a manner, with gold and silver. My conductor\\r\\ntold me this was the house of a worthy Scotch lord, who, using the\\r\\nprivilege of his peerage, had set up public gaming tables, from the\\r\\nprofits of which he drew a comfortable livelihood. He then explained\\r\\nthe difference between the sitters and the bettors; characterised the\\r\\nfirst as old rooks, and the last as bubbles; and advised me to try my\\r\\nfortune at the silver table, by betting a crown at a time. Before I\\r\\nwould venture anything, I considered the company more particularly, and\\r\\nthere appeared such a group of villanous faces, that I was struck with\\r\\nhorror and astonishment at the sight! I signified my surprise to\\r\\nBanter, who whispered in my ear, that the bulk of those present were\\r\\nsharpers, highwaymen, and apprentices, who, having embezzled their\\r\\nmasterâ\\x80\\x99s cash, made a desperate push in this place to make up their\\r\\ndeficiencies. This account did not encourage me to hazard any part of\\r\\nmy small pittance: but, at length, being teased by the importunities of\\r\\nmy friend, who assured me there was no danger of being ill-used,\\r\\nbecause people were hired by the owner to see justice done to\\r\\neverybody, I began by risking one shilling, and, in less than an hour,\\r\\nmy winning amounted to thirty. Convinced by this time of the fairness\\r\\nof the game, and animated with success, there was no need of further\\r\\npersuasion to continue the play: I lent Banter (who seldom had any\\r\\nmoney in his pocket) a guinea, which he carried to the gold table, and\\r\\nlost in a moment. He would have borrowed another, but finding me deaf\\r\\nto his arguments, went away in a pet. Meanwhile my gain advanced to six\\r\\npieces, and my desire of more increased in proportion: so that I moved\\r\\nto the higher table, where I laid half-a-guinea on every throw, and\\r\\nfortune still favouring me, I became a sitter, in which capacity I\\r\\nremained until it was broad day; when I found myself, after many\\r\\nvicissitudes, one hundred and fifty guineas in pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nThinking it now high time to retire with my booty, I asked if anybody\\r\\nwould take my place, and made a notion to rise; upon which an old\\r\\nGascon, who sat opposite to me, and of whom I had won a little money,\\r\\nstarted up with fury in his looks, crying, â\\x80\\x9cRestez, foutre, restez! il\\r\\nfaut donner moi mon ravanchio!â\\x80\\x9d At the same time, a Jew, who sat near\\r\\nthe other, insinuated that I was more beholden to art than fortune for\\r\\nwhat I had got; that he had observed me wipe the table very often, and\\r\\nthat some of the divisions appeared to be greasy. This intimation\\r\\nproduced a great deal of clamour against me, especially among the\\r\\nlosers, who threatened with many oaths and imprecations, to take me up\\r\\nby a warrant as a sharper, unless I would compromise the affair by\\r\\nrefunding the greatest part of my winning. Though I was far from being\\r\\neasy under his accusation, I relied upon my innocence, threatened in my\\r\\nturn to prosecute the Jew, for defamation, and boldly offered to submit\\r\\nmy cause to the examination of any justice in Westminster; but they\\r\\nknew themselves too well to put their characters on that issue, and\\r\\nfinding that I was not to be intimidated into any concession, dropped\\r\\ntheir plea, and made way for me to withdraw. I would not, however, stir\\r\\nfrom the table until the Israelite had retracted what he had said to my\\r\\ndisadvantage, and asked pardon before the whole assembly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I marched out with my prize, I happened to tread on the toes of a\\r\\ntall raw-boned fellow, with a hooked nose, fierce eyes, black thick\\r\\neyebrows, a pigtail wig of the same colour, and a formidable hat pulled\\r\\nover his forehead, who stood gnawing his fingers in the crowd, and he\\r\\nsooner felt the application of my shoe heel, than he roared out in a\\r\\ntremendous voice, â\\x80\\x9cBlood and wounds! you son of a whore, whatâ\\x80\\x99s that\\r\\nfor?â\\x80\\x9d I asked pardon with a great deal of submission, and protested I\\r\\nhad no intention of hurting him; but the more I humbled myself the more\\r\\nhe stormed, and insisted on gentlemanly satisfaction, at the same time\\r\\nprovoking me with scandalous names that I could not put up with; so\\r\\nthat I gave loose to my passion, returned his Billingsgate, and\\r\\nchallenged him down to the piazzas. His indignation cooling as mine\\r\\nwarmed, he refused my invitation, saying he would choose his own time,\\r\\nand returned towards the table muttering threats, which I neither\\r\\ndreaded nor distinctly heard; but, descending with great deliberation,\\r\\nreceived my sword from the door-keeper, whom I gratified with a guinea,\\r\\naccording to the custom of the place, and went home in a rapture of\\r\\njoy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy faithful valet, who had set up all night in the utmost uneasiness on\\r\\nmy account, let me in with his face beslubbered with tears, and\\r\\nfollowed me to my chamber, where he stood silent like a condemned\\r\\ncriminal, in expectation of hearing that every shilling was spent, I\\r\\nguessed the situation of his thoughts, and, assuming a sullen look,\\r\\nbade him fetch me some water to wash. He replied, without lifting his\\r\\neyes from the ground, â\\x80\\x9cIn my simple conjecture, you have more occasion\\r\\nfor rest, not having (I suppose) slept these four-and-twenty hours.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBring me some water!â\\x80\\x9d said I, in a peremptory tone; upon which he\\r\\nsneaked away shrugging his shoulders. Before he returned, I had spread\\r\\nmy whole stock on the table in the most ostentatious manner; so that,\\r\\nwhen it first saluted his view, he stood like one entranced; and,\\r\\nhaving rubbed his eyes more than once, to assure himself of his being\\r\\nawake, broke out into, â\\x80\\x9cLord have mercy upon us, what a vast treasure\\r\\nis here!â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Tis all our own, Strap,â\\x80\\x9d said I; â\\x80\\x9ctake what is necessary,\\r\\nand redeem the sword immediately.â\\x80\\x9d He advanced towards the table,\\r\\nstopped short by the way, looked at the money and me by turns, and with\\r\\na wildness in his countenance, produced from joy checked by distrust,\\r\\ncried, â\\x80\\x9cI dare say it is honestly come by.â\\x80\\x9d To remove his scruples, I\\r\\nmade him acquainted with the whole story of my success, which, when he\\r\\nheard, he danced about the room in an ecstacy, crying, â\\x80\\x9cGod be\\r\\npraised!â\\x80\\x94a white stone!â\\x80\\x94God be praised!â\\x80\\x94a white stone!â\\x80\\x9d So that I was\\r\\nafraid the change of fortune had disordered his intellects, and that he\\r\\nwas run mad with joy. Extremely concerned at this event, I attempted to\\r\\nreason him out of his frenzy, but to no purpose; for without regarding\\r\\nwhat I said, he continued to frisk up and down, and repeat his\\r\\nrhapsody, of â\\x80\\x9cGod be praised!â\\x80\\x94a white stone!â\\x80\\x9d At last, I rose in the\\r\\nutmost consternation, and, laying violent hands upon him, put a stop to\\r\\nhis extravagance by fixing him down to a settee that was in the room.\\r\\nThis constraint banished his delirium; he started as if just awoke, and\\r\\nterrified at my behaviour, cried, â\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter!â\\x80\\x9d When he learned\\r\\nthe cause of my apprehension, he was ashamed of his transports, and\\r\\ntold me, that in mentioning the white stone, he alluded to the Dies\\r\\nfasti of the Romans, albo lapide notati.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving no inclination to sleep, I secured my cash, dressed, and was\\r\\njust going abroad, when the servant of the house told me, there was a\\r\\ngentlewoman at the door who wanted to speak with me. Surprised at this\\r\\ninformation, I made Strap show her up, and in less than a minute, saw a\\r\\nyoung woman of a shabby decayed appearance enter my room. After\\r\\nhalf-a-dozen curtsies, she began to sob, and told me her name was\\r\\nGawky; upon which information I immediately recollected the features of\\r\\nMiss Lavement, who had been the first occasion of my misfortunes.\\r\\nThough I had all the reason in the world to resent her treacherous\\r\\nbehaviour to me, I was moved at her distress, and professing my sorrow\\r\\nat seeing her so reduced desired her to sit, and inquired into the\\r\\nparticulars of her situation. She fell upon her knees and implored my\\r\\nforgiveness for the injuries she had done me, protesting before God,\\r\\nthat she was forced, against her inclination, into that hellish\\r\\nconspiracy which had almost deprived me of my life, by the entreaties\\r\\nof her husband, who, having been afterwards renounced by his father on\\r\\naccount of his marriage with her, and unable to support a family on his\\r\\npay, left his wife at her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house, and went with the regiment to\\r\\nGermany, where he was broke for misbehaviour at the battle of\\r\\nDettingen; since which time she had heard no tidings of him. She then\\r\\ngave me to understand, with many symptoms of penitence, that it was her\\r\\nmisfortune to bear a child four months after marriage, by which event\\r\\nher parents were so incensed, that she was turned out of doors with the\\r\\ninfant, that died soon after: and had hitherto subsisted in a miserable\\r\\nindigent manner, on the extorted charity of a few friends, who were now\\r\\nquite tired of giving; that, not knowing where or how to support\\r\\nherself one day longer, she had fled for succour even to me, who, of\\r\\nall mankind, had the least cause to assist her, relying upon the\\r\\ngenerosity of my disposition, which, she hoped, would be pleased with\\r\\nthis opportunity of avenging itself in the noblest manner on the wretch\\r\\nwho had wronged me. I was very much affected with her discourse and,\\r\\nhaving no cause to suspect the sincerity of her repentance, raised her\\r\\nup, freely pardoned all she had done against me, and promised to\\r\\nbefriend her as much as lay in my power.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince my last arrival in London, I had made no advances to the\\r\\napothecary, imagining it would be impossible for me to make my\\r\\ninnocence appear, so unhappily was my accusation circumstanced: Strap\\r\\nindeed had laboured to justify me to the schoolmaster; but, far from\\r\\nsucceeding in his attempt, Mr. Concordance dropped all correspondence\\r\\nwith him, because he refused to quit his connection with me. Things\\r\\nbeing in this situation, I thought a fairer opportunity of vindicating\\r\\nmy character could not offer than that which now presented itself; I\\r\\ntherefore stipulated with Mrs. Gawky, that before I would yield her the\\r\\nleast assistance, she should do me the justice to clear my reputation\\r\\nby explaining upon oath before a magistrate the whole of the\\r\\nconspiracy, as it had been executed against me. When she had given me\\r\\nthis satisfaction, I presented her with five guineas, a sum so much\\r\\nabove her expectation, that she could scarce believe the evidence of\\r\\nher senses, and was ready to worship me for my benevolence. The\\r\\ndeclaration, signed with her own hand, I sent to her father, who, upon\\r\\nrecollecting and comparing the circumstances of my charge, was\\r\\nconvinced of my integrity, and waited on me next day, in company with\\r\\nhis friend the schoolmaster, to whom he had communicated my\\r\\nvindication. After mutual salutation, Monsieur Lavement began a long\\r\\napology for the unjust treatment I had received; but I saved him a good\\r\\ndeal of breath by interrupting his harangue, and assuring him that, far\\r\\nfrom entertaining a resentment against him, I thought myself obliged to\\r\\nhis lenity, which allowed me to escape, after such strong assumptions\\r\\nof guilt appeared against me. Mr. Concordance, thinking it now his turn\\r\\nto speak, observed that Mr. Random had too much candour and sagacity to\\r\\nbe disobliged at their conduct, which, all things considered, could not\\r\\nhave been otherwise with any honesty of intention. â\\x80\\x9cIndeed,â\\x80\\x9d said he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cif the plot had been unravelled to us by any supernatural\\r\\nintelligence; if it had been whispered by a genius, communicated by\\r\\ndream, or revealed by an angel from on high, we should have been to\\r\\nblame in crediting ocular demonstration; but as we were left in the\\r\\nmidst of mortality, it cannot be expected we should be incapable of\\r\\nimposition. I must assure you, Mr. Random, no man on earth is more\\r\\npleased than I am at this triumph of your character: and, as the news\\r\\nof your misfortune panged me to the very entrails, this manifestation\\r\\nof your innocence makes my midriff quiver with joy.â\\x80\\x9d I thanked him for\\r\\nthis concern, desired them to undeceive those of their acquaintance who\\r\\njudged harshly of me, and, having treated them with a glass of wine,\\r\\nrepresented to Lavement the deplorable condition of his daughter, and\\r\\npleaded her cause so effectually, that he consented to settle a small\\r\\nannuity on her for life: but could not be persuaded to take her home,\\r\\nbecause her mother was so much incensed, that she would never see her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI purchase new Clothesâ\\x80\\x94reprimand Strutwell and Straddleâ\\x80\\x94Banter proposes\\r\\nanother matrimonial Schemeâ\\x80\\x94I accept of his Termsâ\\x80\\x94set out to Bath in the\\r\\nStage-coach with the young Lady and her Motherâ\\x80\\x94the Behaviour of an\\r\\nOfficer and Lawyerâ\\x80\\x94our fellow Travellers describedâ\\x80\\x94a smart dialogue\\r\\nbetween my Mistress and the Captain\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving finished this affair to my satisfaction, I found myself\\r\\nperfectly at ease; and, looking upon the gaming-table as a certain\\r\\nresource for a gentleman in want, became more gay than ever. Although\\r\\nmy clothes were almost as good as new, I grew ashamed of wearing them,\\r\\nbecause I thought everybody by this time had got an inventory of my\\r\\nwardrobe. For which reason I disposed of a good part of my apparel to a\\r\\nsalesman in Monmouth Street for half the value, and bought two new\\r\\nsuits with the money. I likewise purchased a plain gold watch,\\r\\ndespairing of recovering that which I had so foolishly given to\\r\\nStrutwell, whom, notwithstanding, I still continued to visit at his\\r\\nlevee, until the ambassador he had mentioned set out with a secretary\\r\\nof his own choosing. I thought myself then at liberty to expostulate\\r\\nwith his lordship, whom I treated with great freedom in a letter, for\\r\\namusing me with vain hopes, when he neither had the power nor\\r\\ninclination to provide for me. Nor was I less reserved with Straddle,\\r\\nwhom I in person reproached for misrepresenting to me the character of\\r\\nStrutwell, which I did not scruple to aver was infamous in every\\r\\nrespect. He seemed very much enraged at my freedom, talked a great deal\\r\\nabout his quality and honour, and began to make some comparisons which\\r\\nI thought so injurious to mine, that I demanded an explanation with\\r\\ngreat warmth, and he was mean enough to equivocate, and condescend in\\r\\nsuch a manner that I left him with a hearty contempt of his behaviour.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout this time, Banter, who had observed a surprising and sudden\\r\\nalteration in my appearance and disposition, began to inquire very\\r\\nminutely into the cause, and, as I did not think fit to let him know\\r\\nthe true state of the affair, lest he might make free with my purse, on\\r\\nthe strength of having proposed the scheme that filled it, I told him\\r\\nthat I had received a small supply from a relation in the country, who\\r\\nat the same time had proffered to use all his interest (which was not\\r\\nsmall) in soliciting some post for me that should make me easy for\\r\\nlife. â\\x80\\x9cIf that be the case,â\\x80\\x9d said Banter, â\\x80\\x9cperhaps you wonâ\\x80\\x99t care to\\r\\nmortify yourself a little in making your fortune another way. I have a\\r\\nrelation who is to set out for Bath next week, with an only daughter,\\r\\nwho being sickly and decrepit, intends to drink the waters for the\\r\\nrecovery of her health. Her father, who was a rich Turkey merchant,\\r\\ndied about a year ago, and left her with a fortune of twenty thousand\\r\\npounds, under the sole management of her mother, who is my kinswoman. I\\r\\nwould have put in for the plate myself, but there is a breach at\\r\\npresent between the old woman and me. You must know, that some time ago\\r\\nI borrowed a small sum of her and promised, it seems, to pay it before\\r\\na certain time; but being disappointed in my expectation of money from\\r\\nthe country, the day elapsed without my being able to take up my note;\\r\\nupon which she wrote a peremptory letter, threatening to arrest me, if\\r\\nI did not pay the debt immediately. Nettled at this precise behaviour,\\r\\nI sent a dâ\\x80\\x94d severe answer, which enraged her so much that she actually\\r\\ntook out a writ against me. Whereupon, finding the thing grow serious,\\r\\nI got a friend to advance the money for me, discharged the debt, went\\r\\nto her house, and abused her for her unfriendly dealing. She was\\r\\nprovoked by my reproaches, and scolded in her turn. The little deformed\\r\\nurchin joined her mother with such virulence and volubility of tongue,\\r\\nthat I was fain to make a retreat, after having been honoured with a\\r\\ngreat many scandalous epithets, which gave me plainly to understand\\r\\nthat I had nothing to hope from the esteem of the one, or the affection\\r\\nof the other. As they are both utter strangers to life, it is a\\r\\nthousand to one that the girl will be picked up by some scoundrel or\\r\\nother at Bath, if I donâ\\x80\\x99t provide for her otherwise. You are a\\r\\nwell-looking fellow, Random, and can behave as demurely as a quaker. If\\r\\nyou will give me an obligation of five hundred pounds, to be paid six\\r\\nmonths after your marriage, I will put you in a method of carrying her\\r\\nin spite of all opposition.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis proposal was too advantageous for me to be refused. The writing\\r\\nwas immediately drawn up and executed; and Banter, giving me notice of\\r\\nthe time when, and the stage coach in which they were to set out, I\\r\\nbespoke a place in the same convenience; and, having hired a horse for\\r\\nStrap, who was chagrined with the prospect, set forward accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we embarked before day, I had not the pleasure for some time of\\r\\nseeing Miss Snapper (that was the name of my mistress), nor even of\\r\\nperceiving the number and sex of my fellow travellers, although I\\r\\nguessed that the coach was full, by the difficulty I found in seating\\r\\nmyself. The first five minutes passed in a general silence, when, all\\r\\nof a sudden, the coach heeling to one side, a boisterous voice\\r\\npronounced, â\\x80\\x9cTo the right and left, cover your flanks, dâ\\x80\\x94me! whiz!â\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\neasily discovered by the tone and matter of this exclamation that it\\r\\nwas uttered by a son of Mars; neither was it hard to conceive the\\r\\nprofession of another person who sat opposite to me, and observed that\\r\\nwe ought to have been well satisfied of our security before we entered\\r\\nupon the premises. These two sallies had not the desired effect. We\\r\\ncontinued a good while as mute as before, till at length the gentleman\\r\\nof the sword, impatient of longer silence, made a second effort, by\\r\\nswearing he had got into a meeting of quakers. â\\x80\\x9cI believe so too,â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\na shrill female voice at my left hand, â\\x80\\x9cfor the spirit of folly begins\\r\\nto move.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOut with it then, madam!â\\x80\\x9d replied the soldier. â\\x80\\x9cYou seem to\\r\\nhave no occasion for a midwife,â\\x80\\x9d cried the lady. â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94mn my blood!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nexclaimed the other, â\\x80\\x9ca man canâ\\x80\\x99t talk to a woman, but she immediately\\r\\nthinks of a midwife.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTrue sir,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cI long to be delivered.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat ofâ\\x80\\x94a mouse, madam?â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cNo, Sir,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cof a fool.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you far gone with a fool?â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cLittle more than two miles,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid she. â\\x80\\x9cBy Gad, youâ\\x80\\x99re a wit, madam,â\\x80\\x9d cried the officer, â\\x80\\x9cI wish I\\r\\ncould with any justice return the compliment,â\\x80\\x9d said the lady. â\\x80\\x9cZounds,\\r\\nI have done,â\\x80\\x9d said he. â\\x80\\x9cYour bolt is soon shot, according to the old\\r\\nproverb,â\\x80\\x9d said she. The warriorâ\\x80\\x99s powder was quite spent; the lawyer\\r\\nadvised him to drop the prosecution, and a grave matron, who sat on the\\r\\nleft hand of the victorious wit, told her she must not let her tongue\\r\\nrun so fast among strangers. This reprimand, softened with the\\r\\nappellation of child, convinced me that the satirical lady was no other\\r\\nthan Miss Snapper, and I resolved to regulate my conduct accordingly.\\r\\nThe champion, finding himself so smartly handled, changed his battery,\\r\\nand began to expatiate on his own exploits. â\\x80\\x9cYou talk of shot, madam,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid he; â\\x80\\x9cdâ\\x80\\x94me! I have both given and received some shot in my timeâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nwas wounded in the shoulder by a pistol ball at Dettingen, whereâ\\x80\\x94I say\\r\\nnothingâ\\x80\\x94but by Gâ\\x80\\x94d! if it had not been for meâ\\x80\\x94allâ\\x80\\x99s one for thatâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\ndespise boasting, dâ\\x80\\x94me! whiz!â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he whistled one part and\\r\\nhummed another, of the Black Joke; then, addressing himself to the\\r\\nlawyer, went on thus; â\\x80\\x9cWouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you think it dâ\\x80\\x94d hard, after having, at\\r\\nthe risk of your life, recovered the standard of a regiment that had\\r\\nbeen lost, to receive no preferment for your pains? I donâ\\x80\\x99t choose to\\r\\nname no names, sink me! but, howsomever, this I will refer, by Gâ\\x80\\x94d! and\\r\\nthat is thisâ\\x80\\x94a musketeer of the French guards, having a standard from a\\r\\ncertain cornet of a certain regiment, dâ\\x80\\x94e! was retreating with his\\r\\nprize as fast as his horseâ\\x80\\x99s heels could carry him, sink me! Upon\\r\\nwhich, I snatched up firelock that belonged to a dead man, dâ\\x80\\x94me! Whiz!\\r\\nand shot his horse under him, dâ\\x80\\x94n my blood! The fellow got upon his\\r\\nfeet, and began to repose me, upon which I charged my bayonet breast\\r\\nhigh, and ran him through the body by Gâ\\x80\\x94! One of his comrades, coming\\r\\nto his assistance, shot me in the shoulder, as I told you before; and\\r\\nanother gave me a contusion on the head with the butt-end of his\\r\\ncarbine; but, dâ\\x80\\x94me, that did not signify. I killed one, put the other\\r\\nto flight, and taking up the standard, carried it off very\\r\\ndeliberately. But the best joke of all was the son of a bâ\\x80\\x94ch of a\\r\\ncornet, who had surrendered it in a cowardly manner, seeing it in my\\r\\npossession, demanded it from me in the front of the line. â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n my\\r\\nblood!â\\x80\\x9d says he, â\\x80\\x9cwhere did you find my standard?â\\x80\\x9d says he. â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n my\\r\\nblood!â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cwhere,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cdid you lose it?â\\x80\\x9d said I. â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nnothing to you,â\\x80\\x9d says he, â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99tis my standard,â\\x80\\x9d says heâ\\x80\\x9d and by Gâ\\x80\\x94d Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nhave it,â\\x80\\x9d says he. â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94nation seize me,â\\x80\\x9d says I, â\\x80\\x9cif you shall,â\\x80\\x9d says I,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctill I have first delivered it to the general,â\\x80\\x9d says I; and\\r\\naccordingly I went to the headquarters after the battle, and delivered\\r\\nit to my Lord Stair, who promised to do for me. But I am no more than a\\r\\npoor lieutenant still, dâ\\x80\\x94n my blood.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving vented this repetition of expletives, the lawyer owned he had\\r\\nnot been requited according to his deserts; observed that the labourer\\r\\nis always worthy of his hire, and asked if the promise was made before\\r\\nwitnesses, because in that case the law would compel the general to\\r\\nperform it; but understanding that the promise was made over a bottle,\\r\\nwithout being restricted to time or terms, he pronounced it not valid\\r\\nin law, proceeded to inquire into the particulars of the battle, and\\r\\naffirmed that, although the English had drawn themselves into premunire\\r\\nat first, the French managed their cause so lamely in the course of the\\r\\ndispute, that they would have been utterly nonsuited, had they not\\r\\nobtained a nolli prosequi. In spite of these enlivening touches, the\\r\\nconversation was like to suffer another long interruption, when the\\r\\nlieutenant, unwilling to conceal any of his accomplishments that could\\r\\nbe displayed in his present situation, offered to regale the company\\r\\nwith a song; and, interpreting our silence into a desire of hearing,\\r\\nbegan to warble a fashionable air the first stanza of which he\\r\\npronounced thus:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWould you task the moon-tide hair,\\r\\nTo yon flagrant beau repair.\\r\\nWhere waving with the poplin vow,\\r\\nThe bantling fine will shelter you,â\\x80\\x9d etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sense of the rest he perverted as he went on with such surprising\\r\\nfacility that I could not help thinking he had been at some pains to\\r\\nburlesque the performance. Miss Snapper ascribed it to the true cause,\\r\\nnamely ignorance; and, when he asked her how she relished his music,\\r\\nanswered that, in her opinion, the music and the words were much of a\\r\\npiece. â\\x80\\x9cOh, dâ\\x80\\x94n my blood!â\\x80\\x9d said he â\\x80\\x9cI take that as a high compliment;\\r\\nfor everybody allows the words are dâ\\x80\\x94able fine.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cThey may be so,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nreplied the lady, â\\x80\\x9cfor aught I know, but they are above my\\r\\ncomprehension.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cI anâ\\x80\\x99t obliged to find you comprehension, madam, curse\\r\\nme!â\\x80\\x9d cried he. â\\x80\\x9cNo, nor to speak sense neither,â\\x80\\x9d said she. â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n my\\r\\nheart,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll speak what I please.â\\x80\\x9d Here the lawyer\\r\\ninterposed, by telling him, there were some things he must not speak;\\r\\nand upon being defied to give an instance, mentioned treason and\\r\\ndefamation. â\\x80\\x9cAs for the king,â\\x80\\x9d cried the soldier, â\\x80\\x9cGod bless himâ\\x80\\x94I eat\\r\\nhis bread, and have lost blood in his cause, therefore I have nothing\\r\\nto say to himâ\\x80\\x94but, by Gâ\\x80\\x94d, I dare say anything to any other man.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid the lawyer, â\\x80\\x9cyou dare not call me rogue.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94me, for what?â\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nthe other. â\\x80\\x9cBecause,â\\x80\\x9d replied the counsellor, â\\x80\\x9cI should have it good\\r\\naction against you, and recover.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWell, well,â\\x80\\x9d cried the officer, â\\x80\\x9cif\\r\\nI dare not call you rogue, I dare think you one, dâ\\x80\\x94me!â\\x80\\x9d This stroke of\\r\\nwit he accompanied with a loud laugh of self-approbation, which\\r\\nunluckily did not affect the audience, but effectually silenced his\\r\\nantagonist, who did not open his mouth for the space of an hour, except\\r\\nto clear his pipe with three hems, which however, produced nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDay breaking, I have the Pleasure of viewing the Person of Miss\\r\\nSnapper, whom I had not seen beforeâ\\x80\\x94the Soldier is witty upon meâ\\x80\\x94is\\r\\noffendedâ\\x80\\x94talks much of his Valourâ\\x80\\x94is reprimanded by a grave\\r\\nGentlewomanâ\\x80\\x94we are alarmed by the cry of Highwaymenâ\\x80\\x94I get out of the\\r\\nCoach, and stand in my own defenceâ\\x80\\x94they ride off without having\\r\\nattacked usâ\\x80\\x94I pursue themâ\\x80\\x94one of them is thrown from his Horse and\\r\\ntakenâ\\x80\\x94I return to the Coachâ\\x80\\x94am complimented by Miss Snapperâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nCaptainâ\\x80\\x99s Behaviour on this Occasionâ\\x80\\x94the Prude reproaches me in a\\r\\nSoliloquyâ\\x80\\x94I upbraid her in the same Mannerâ\\x80\\x94the Behaviour of Miss\\r\\nSnapper, at Breakfast, disobliges meâ\\x80\\x94the Lawyer is witty upon the\\r\\nOfficer, who threatens him\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meantime, the day breaking in upon us, discovered to one another\\r\\nthe faces of their fellow travellers: and I had the good fortune to\\r\\nfind my mistress not quite so deformed nor disagreeable as she had been\\r\\nrepresented to me. Her head, indeed, bore some resemblance to a\\r\\nhatchet, the edge being represented by her face; but she had a certain\\r\\ndelicacy in her complexion, and a great deal of vivacity in her eyes,\\r\\nwhich were very large and black; and, though the protuberance of her\\r\\nbreast, when considered alone, seemed to drag her forwards, it was easy\\r\\nto perceive an equivalent on her back which balanced the other, and\\r\\nkept her body in equilibrio. On the whole, I thought I should have\\r\\ngreat reason to congratulate myself if it should be my fate to possess\\r\\ntwenty thousand pounds encumbered with such a wife. I began therefore\\r\\nto deliberate about the most probable means of acquiring the conquest,\\r\\nand was so much engrossed by this idea, that I scarce took any notice\\r\\nof the rest of the people in the coach, but revolved my project in\\r\\nsilence; while the conversation was maintained as before by the object\\r\\nof my hopes, the son of Mars, and the barrister, who by this time\\r\\nrecollected himself, and talked in terms as much as ever. At length a\\r\\ndispute happened, which ended in a wager, to be determined by me, who\\r\\nwas so much absorbed in contemplation, that I neither heard the\\r\\nreference nor the question which was put to me by each in his turn.\\r\\nAffronted at my supposed contempt, the soldier with great vociferation\\r\\nswore I was either dumb or deaf if not both, and that I looked as if I\\r\\ncould not say Bo to a goose. Aroused at this observation, I fixed my\\r\\neyes upon him, and pronounced with emphasis the interjection Bo! Upon\\r\\nwhich he cocked his hat in a fierce manner, and cried, â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94me sir, what\\r\\ndâ\\x80\\x99ye mean by that.â\\x80\\x9d Had I intended to answer him, which by the by was\\r\\nnot my design, I should have been anticipated by Miss, who told him, my\\r\\nmeaning was to show, that I could cry Bo to a goose; and laughed very\\r\\nheartily at my laconic reproof. Her explanation and mirth did not help\\r\\nto appease his wrath, which broke out in several martial insinuations,\\r\\nsuch asâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cI do not understand such freedoms, dâ\\x80\\x94me! Dâ\\x80\\x94n my blood! Iâ\\x80\\x99m a\\r\\ngentleman, and bear the kingâ\\x80\\x99s commission. â\\x80\\x99Sblood! some people deserve\\r\\nto have their noses pulled for their impertinence.â\\x80\\x9d I thought to have\\r\\nchecked these ejaculations by a frown; because he had talked so much of\\r\\nhis valour that I had long ago rated him as an ass in a lionâ\\x80\\x99s skin;\\r\\nbut this expedient did not answer my expectation, he took umbrage at\\r\\nthe contraction of my brow, swore he did not value my sulky looks a\\r\\nfigâ\\x80\\x99s end, and protested he feared no man breathing. Miss Snapper said,\\r\\nshe was very glad to find herself in company with a man of so much\\r\\ncourage, who, she did not doubt, would protect her from all the\\r\\nattempts of highwaymen during our journey. â\\x80\\x9cMake yourself perfectly\\r\\neasy on that head, madam,â\\x80\\x9d replied the officer. â\\x80\\x9cI have got a pair of\\r\\npistols (here they are), which I took from a horse officer at the\\r\\nbattle of Dettingen; they are double loaded, and if any highwayman in\\r\\nEngland robs you of the value of a pin while I have the honour of being\\r\\nin your company, dâ\\x80\\x94n my heart.â\\x80\\x9d When he had expressed himself in this\\r\\nmanner, a prim gentlewoman, who had sat silent hitherto, opened her\\r\\nmouth, and said, she wondered how any man could be so rude as to pull\\r\\nout such weapons before ladies. â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94me, madam,â\\x80\\x9d cried the champion, â\\x80\\x9cif\\r\\nyou are so much afraid at the sight of a pistol, how dâ\\x80\\x99ye propose to\\r\\nstand fire if there should be occasion?â\\x80\\x9d She then told him that, if she\\r\\nthought he could be so unmannerly as to use fire-arms in her presence,\\r\\nwhatever might be the occasion, she would get out of the coach\\r\\nimmediately, and walk to the next village, where she might procure a\\r\\nconvenience to herself. Before he could make any answer, my Dulcinea\\r\\ninterposed, and observed that, far from being offended at a gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nusing his arms in his own defence, she thought herself very lucky in\\r\\nbeing along with one by whose valour she stood a good chance of saving\\r\\nherself from being rifled. The prude cast a disdainful look at Miss,\\r\\nand said that people, who have but little to lose, are sometimes the\\r\\nmost solicitous about preserving it. The old lady was affronted at this\\r\\ninuendo, and took notice, that people ought to be very well informed\\r\\nbefore they speak slightingly of other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s fortune, lest they\\r\\ndiscover their own envy, and make themselves ridiculous. The daughter\\r\\ndeclared, that she did not pretend to vie with anybody in point of\\r\\nriches; and if the lady, who insisted upon non-resistance, would\\r\\npromise to indemnify us all for the loss we should sustain, she would\\r\\nbe one of the first to persuade the captain to submission, in case we\\r\\nshould be attacked. To this proposal, reasonable as it was, the\\r\\nreserved lady made no other reply than a scornful glance and a toss of\\r\\nher head. I was very well pleased with the spirit of my young mistress,\\r\\nand even wished for an opportunity of distinguishing my courage under\\r\\nher eye, which I believed could not fail of prepossessing her in my\\r\\nfavour, when all of a sudden Strap rode up to the coach door, and told\\r\\nus in a great fright, that two men on horseback were crossing the heath\\r\\n(for by this time we had passed Hounslow), and made directly towards\\r\\nus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis piece of information was no sooner delivered, than Mrs. Snapper\\r\\nbegan to scream, her daughter grew pale, the old lady pulled out her\\r\\npurse to be in readiness, the lawyerâ\\x80\\x99s teeth chattered, while he\\r\\npronounced, â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x99Tis no matterâ\\x80\\x94weâ\\x80\\x99ll sue the county and recover.â\\x80\\x9d The\\r\\ncaptain gave evident signs of confusion: and I, after having commanded\\r\\nthe coachman to stop, opened the door, jumped out, and invited the\\r\\nwarrior to follow me. But, finding him backward and astonished, I took\\r\\nhis pistols, and, giving them to Strap, who had by this time alighted\\r\\nand trembled very much, I mounted on horseback; and, taking my own\\r\\n(which I could better depend upon) from the holsters, cocked them both,\\r\\nand faced the robbers, who were now very near us. Seeing me ready to\\r\\noppose them on horseback, and another man armed a-foot, they made a\\r\\nhalt at some distance to reconnoitre us: and after having rode round us\\r\\ntwice, myself still facing about as they rode, went off the same way\\r\\nthey came, at a hand gallop. A gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s servant coming up with a\\r\\nhorse at the same time, I offered him a crown to assist me in pursuing\\r\\nthem, which he no sooner accepted, than I armed him with the officerâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npistols, and we galloped after the thieves, who, trusting to the\\r\\nswiftness of their horses, stopped till we came within shot of them and\\r\\nthen, firing at us, put their nags to the full speed. We followed them\\r\\nas fast as our beasts could carry us; but, not being so well mounted as\\r\\nthey, our efforts would have been to little purpose, had not the horse\\r\\nof one of them stumbled, and thrown his rider with such violence over\\r\\nhis head, that he lay senseless when we came up, and was taken without\\r\\nthe least opposition; while his comrade consulted his own safety in\\r\\nflight, without regarding the distress of his friend. We scarce had\\r\\ntime to make ourselves masters of his arms, and tie his hands together,\\r\\nbefore he recovered his senses, when, learning his situation he\\r\\naffected surprise, demanded to know by what authority we used a\\r\\ngentleman in that manner, and had the impudence to threaten us with a\\r\\nprosecution for robbery. In the meantime, we perceived Strap coming up\\r\\nwith a crowd of people, armed up with different kinds of weapons; and\\r\\namong the rest a farmer, who no sooner perceived the thief, whom we had\\r\\nsecured, than he cried with great emotion, â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s the fellow who\\r\\nrobbed me an hour ago of twenty pounds, in a canvas bag.â\\x80\\x9d He was\\r\\nimmediately searched, and the money found exactly as it had been\\r\\ndescribed; upon which we committed him to the charge of the countryman,\\r\\nwho carried him to the town of Hounslow, which, it seems, the farmer\\r\\nhad alarmed; and I, having satisfied the footman for his trouble,\\r\\naccording to promise, returned with Strap to the coach, where I found\\r\\nthe captain and lawyer busy in administering smelling bottles and\\r\\ncordials to the grave lady, who had gone into a fit at the noise of\\r\\nfiring.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had taken my seat, Miss Snapper, who from the coach had seen\\r\\neverything that happened; made me a compliment on my behaviour, and\\r\\nsaid she was glad to see me returned without having received any\\r\\ninjury; her mother too owned herself obliged to my resolution: the\\r\\nlawyer told me, that I was entitled by act of parliament to a reward of\\r\\nforty pounds, for having apprehended a highwayman. The soldier\\r\\nobserved, with a countenance in which impudence and shame struggling,\\r\\nproduced some disorder, that if I had not been in such a dâ\\x80\\x94d hurry to\\r\\nget out of the coach, he would have secured the rogues effectually,\\r\\nwithout all this bustle and loss of time, by a scheme, which my heat\\r\\nand precipitation ruined. â\\x80\\x9cFor my own part,â\\x80\\x9d continued he, â\\x80\\x9cI am always\\r\\nextremely cool on these occasions.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cSo it appeared, by your\\r\\ntrembling,â\\x80\\x9d said the young lady. â\\x80\\x9cDeath and dâ\\x80\\x94ion!â\\x80\\x9d cried he, â\\x80\\x9cyour sex\\r\\nprotects you, madam; if any man on earth durst tell me so much, Iâ\\x80\\x99d\\r\\nsend him to hell, dâ\\x80\\x94n my heart! in an instant.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he fixed his\\r\\neyes upon me, and asked if I had seen him tremble? I answered without\\r\\nhesitation, â\\x80\\x9cYes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94me, sir!â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cdâ\\x80\\x99ye doubt my courage?â\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\nreplied, â\\x80\\x9cVery much.â\\x80\\x9d This declaration quite disconcerted him. He\\r\\nlooked blank, and pronounced with a faltering voice, â\\x80\\x9cOh! itâ\\x80\\x99s very\\r\\nwell: dâ\\x80\\x94n my blood! I shall find a time.â\\x80\\x9d I signified my contempt of\\r\\nhim, by thrusting my tongue in my cheek, which humbled him so much,\\r\\nthat he scarce swore another oath aloud during the whole journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe precise lady, having recruited her spirits by the help of some\\r\\nstrong waters, began a soliloquy, in which she wondered that any man,\\r\\nwho pretended to maintain the character of a gentleman, could, for the\\r\\nsake of a little paltry coin, throw persons of honour into such\\r\\nquandaries as might endanger their lives; and professed her surprise\\r\\nthat women were not ashamed to commend such brutality. At the same time\\r\\nvowing that for the future she would never set foot in a stage coach,\\r\\nif a private convenience could be had for love or money.\\r\\n\\r\\nNettled at her remarks, I took the same method of conveying my\\r\\nsentiments, and wondered in my turn, that any woman of common sense\\r\\nshould be so unreasonable as to expect that people, who had neither\\r\\nacquaintance nor connection with her, would tamely allow themselves to\\r\\nbe robbed and maltreated, merely to indulge her capricious humour. I\\r\\nlikewise confessed my astonishment at her insolence and ingratitude in\\r\\ntaxing a person with brutality, who deserved her approbation and\\r\\nacknowledgment; and vowed that, if ever she should be assaulted again,\\r\\nI would leave her to the mercy of the spoiler, that she might know the\\r\\nvalue of my protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis person of honour did not think fit to carry on the altercation any\\r\\nfurther, but seemed to chew the cud of her resentment with the\\r\\ncrestfallen captain, while I entered into discourse with my charmer,\\r\\nwho was the more pleased with my conversation, as she had conceived a\\r\\nvery indifferent opinion of my intellects from my former silence. I\\r\\nshould have had cause to be equally satisfied with the sprightliness of\\r\\nher genius, could she have curbed her imagination with judgment; but\\r\\nshe laboured under such a profusion of talk, that I dreaded her unruly\\r\\ntongue, and felt by anticipation the horrors of an eternal clack!\\r\\nHowever, when I considered, on the other hand, the joys attending the\\r\\npossession of twenty thousand pounds, I forgot her imperfections,\\r\\nseized occasion by the forelock, and tried to insinuate myself into her\\r\\naffection. The careful mother kept a strict watch over her and though\\r\\nshe could not help behaving civilly to me, took frequent opportunities\\r\\nof discouraging our communication, by reprimanding her for being so\\r\\nfree with strangers, and telling her she must learn to speak less and\\r\\nthink more. Abridged of the use of speech, we conversed with our eyes,\\r\\nand I found the young lady very eloquent in this kind of discourse. In\\r\\nshort, I had reason to believe that she was sick of the old\\r\\ngentlewomanâ\\x80\\x99s tuition, and that I should find it no difficult matter to\\r\\nsupersede her authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we arrived at the place where we were to breakfast, I alighted,\\r\\nand helped my mistress out of the coach, as well as her mother who\\r\\ncalled for a private room to which they withdrew in order to eat by\\r\\nthemselves. As they retired together, I perceived that Miss had got\\r\\nmore twists from nature than I had before observed for she was bent\\r\\nsideways into the figure of an S, so that her progression very much\\r\\nresembled that of a crab. The prude also chose the captain for her\\r\\nmessmate, and ordered breakfast for two only, to be brought into\\r\\nanother separate room: while the lawyer and I, deserted by the rest of\\r\\nthe company, were fain to put up with each other. I was a good deal\\r\\nchagrined at the stately reserve of Mrs. Snapper, who, I thought, did\\r\\nnot use me with all the complaisance I deserved; and my companion\\r\\ndeclared that he had been a traveller for twenty years, and never knew\\r\\nthe stage coach rules so much infringed before. As for the honourable\\r\\ngentlewoman I could not conceive the meaning of her attachment to the\\r\\nlieutenant; and asked the lawyer if he knew for which of the soldierâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nvirtues she admired him? The counsellor facetiously replied, â\\x80\\x9cI suppose\\r\\nthe lady knows him to be an able conveyancer, and wants him to make a\\r\\nsettlement in tail.â\\x80\\x9d I could not help laughing at the archness of the\\r\\nbarrister, who entertained me during breakfast with a great deal of wit\\r\\nof the same kind, at the expense of our fellow travellers; and among\\r\\nother things said, he was sorry to find the young lady saddled with\\r\\nsuch incumbrances.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we had made an end of our repast, and paid our reckoning, we went\\r\\ninto the coach, took our places, and bribed the driver with sixpence to\\r\\nrevenge us on the rest of his fare, by hurrying them away in the midst\\r\\nof their meal. This task he performed to our satisfaction, after he had\\r\\ndisturbed their enjoyment with his importunate clamour. The mother and\\r\\ndaughter obeyed the summons first, and, coming to the coach door, were\\r\\nobliged to desire the coachmanâ\\x80\\x99s assistance to get in, because the\\r\\nlawyer and I had agreed to show our resentment by our neglect. They\\r\\nwere no sooner seated, than the captain appeared, as much heated as if\\r\\nhe had been pursued a dozen miles by an enemy; and immediately after\\r\\nhim came the lady, not without some marks of disorder. Having helped\\r\\nher up, he entered himself, growling a few oaths against the coachman\\r\\nfor his impertinent interruption; and the lawyer comforted him by\\r\\nsaying, that if he had suffered a nisi prius through the obstinacy of\\r\\nthe defendant, he might have an opportunity to join issue at the next\\r\\nstage. This last expression gave offence to the grave gentlewoman, who\\r\\ntold him, if she was a man, she would make him repent of such\\r\\nobscenity, and thanked God she had never been in such company before.\\r\\nAt this insinuation the captain thought himself under a necessity of\\r\\nespousing the ladyâ\\x80\\x99s cause; and accordingly threatened to cut off the\\r\\nlawyerâ\\x80\\x99s ears, if he should give his tongue any such liberties for the\\r\\nfuture. The poor counsellor begged pardon, and universal silence\\r\\nensued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI resolve to ingratiate myself with the Mother, and am favoured by\\r\\naccidentâ\\x80\\x94the Precise Lady finds her husband, and quit the Coachâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nCaptain is disappointed of his dinnerâ\\x80\\x94we arrive at Bathâ\\x80\\x94I accompany\\r\\nMiss Snapper to the Long-room, where she is attacked by beau Nash, and,\\r\\nturns the Laugh against himâ\\x80\\x94I make love to her, and receive a\\r\\ncheckâ\\x80\\x94Squire her to an Assembly, where I am blessed with a Sight of my\\r\\ndear Narcissa, which discomposes me so much, that Miss Snapper,\\r\\nobserving my disorder, is at pains to discover the Causeâ\\x80\\x94is piqued at\\r\\nthe Occasion, and, in our way home, pays me a sarcastic Complimentâ\\x80\\x94I am\\r\\nmet by Miss Williams, who is the maid and Confidante of Narcissaâ\\x80\\x94she\\r\\nacquaints me with her Ladyâ\\x80\\x99s regard for me while under the disguise of\\r\\na Servant, and describes the Transports of Narcissa on seeing me at the\\r\\nAssembly, in the Character of a Gentlemanâ\\x80\\x94I am surprised with an\\r\\nAccount of her Auntâ\\x80\\x99s Marriage, and make an Appointment to meet Miss\\r\\nWilliams the next day\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this unsocial interval, my pride and interest maintained a\\r\\nsevere conflict on the subject of Miss Snapper, whom the one\\r\\nrepresented as unworthy of notice, and the other proposed as the object\\r\\nof my whole attention: the advantages and disadvantages of such a match\\r\\nwere opposed to one another by my imagination; and, at length, my\\r\\njudgment gave it so much in favour of the first, that I resolved to\\r\\nprosecute my scheme with all the address in my power. I thought I\\r\\nperceived some concern in her countenance, occasioned by my silence,\\r\\nwhich she, no doubt, imputed to my disgust at her motherâ\\x80\\x99s behaviour;\\r\\nand, as I believed the old woman could not fail of ascribing my\\r\\nmuteness to the same motive, I determined to continue that sullen\\r\\nconduct towards her, and fall upon some other method of manifesting my\\r\\nesteem for the daughter, nor was it difficult for me to make her\\r\\nacquainted with my sentiments by the expression of my looks, which I\\r\\nmodelled into the character of humanity and love; and which were\\r\\nanswered by her with all the sympathy and approbation I could desire.\\r\\nBut when I began to consider, that, without further opportunities of\\r\\nimproving my success, all the progress I had hitherto made would not\\r\\nmuch avail, and that such opportunities could not be enjoyed without\\r\\nthe motherâ\\x80\\x99s permission, I concluded it would be requisite to vanquish\\r\\nher coldness and suspicion by my assiduities and respectful behaviour\\r\\non the road; and she would, in all likelihood, invite me to visit her\\r\\nat Bath, where I did not fear of being able to cultivate her\\r\\nacquaintance as much as would be necessary to the accomplishment of my\\r\\npurpose. And indeed accident furnished me with an opportunity of\\r\\nobliging her so much that she could not, with any appearance of good\\r\\nmanners, forbear to gratify my inclination.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we arrived at our dining-place, we found all the eatables at the\\r\\ninn bespoke by a certain nobleman, who had got the start of us and, in\\r\\nall likelihood, my mistress and her mother must have dined with Duke\\r\\nHumphrey, had I not exerted myself in their behalf, and bribed the\\r\\nlandlord with a glass of wine to curtail his lordshipâ\\x80\\x99s entertainment\\r\\nof a couple of fowls and some bacon, which I sent with my compliments\\r\\nto the ladies. They accepted my treat with a great many thanks, and\\r\\ndesired I would favour them with my company at dinner, where I amused\\r\\nthe old gentlewoman so successfully, by maintaining a seemingly\\r\\ndisinterested ease in the midst of my civility, that she signified a\\r\\ndesire of being better acquainted, and hoped I would be so kind as to\\r\\nsee her sometimes at Bath. While I enjoyed myself in this manner, the\\r\\nprecise lady had the good fortune to meet with her husband, who was no\\r\\nother than gentleman, or, in other words, valet-de-chambre, to the very\\r\\nnobleman whose coach stood at the door. Proud of the interest she had\\r\\nin the house, she affected to show her power by introducing the captain\\r\\nto her spouse as a person who had treated her with great civility upon\\r\\nwhich he was invited to a share of their dinner; while the poor lawyer,\\r\\nfinding himself utterly abandoned, made application to me, and was\\r\\nthrough my intercession admitted into our company. Having satisfied our\\r\\nappetites, and made ourselves merry at the expense of the person of\\r\\nhonour, the civil captain, and complaisant husband, I did myself the\\r\\npleasure of discharging the bill by stealth, for which I received a\\r\\ngreat many apologies and acknowledgments from my guests, and we\\r\\nre-embarked at the first warning. The officer was obliged, at last, to\\r\\nappease his hunger with a luncheon of bread and cheese, and a pint\\r\\nbottle of brandy, which he dispatched in the coach, cursing the\\r\\ninappetence of his lordship, who had ordered dinner to be put back a\\r\\nwhole hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey,\\r\\nwhich was finished next day, when I waited on the ladies to the house\\r\\nof a relation, in which they intended to lodge, and, passing that night\\r\\nat the inn, took lodgings in the morning for myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forenoon was spent in visiting everything that was worth seeing in\\r\\nthe place, in company with a gentleman to whom Banter had given me a\\r\\nletter of introduction; and in the afternoon I waited on the ladies,\\r\\nand found Miss a good deal indisposed with the fatigue of their\\r\\njourney. As they foresaw they should have occasion for a male\\r\\nacquaintance to squire them at all public places, I was received with\\r\\ngreat cordiality, and had the motherâ\\x80\\x99s permission to conduct them next\\r\\nday to the Long Room, which we no sooner entered, than the eyes of\\r\\neverybody present were turned upon us, and, when we had suffered the\\r\\nmartyrdom of their looks for some time, a whisper circulated at our\\r\\nexpense, which was accompanied with many contemptuous smiles and\\r\\ntittering observations, to my utter shame and confusion. I did not so\\r\\nmuch conduct as follow my charge to a place where she seated her mother\\r\\nand herself with astonishing composure notwithstanding the unmannerly\\r\\nbehaviour of the whole company, which seemed to be assumed merely to\\r\\nput her out of countenance. The celebrated Mr. Nash, who commonly\\r\\nattends in this place, as master of the ceremonies, perceiving the\\r\\ndisposition of the assembly, took upon himself the task of gratifying\\r\\ntheir ill-nature further, by exposing my mistress to the edge of his\\r\\nwit. With this view he approached us, with many bows and grimaces, and,\\r\\nafter having welcomed Miss Snapper to the place, asked her in the\\r\\nhearing of all present, if she could inform him of the name of Tobitâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndog. Miss was so much incensed at his insolence, that I should\\r\\ncertainly have kicked him where he stood without ceremony, had not the\\r\\nyoung lady prevented the effects of my indignation, by replying with\\r\\nthe utmost vivacity, â\\x80\\x9cHis name was Nash, and an impudent dog he was.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThis repartee so unexpected and just, raised such a universal laugh at\\r\\nthe aggressor, that all his assurance was insufficient to support him\\r\\nunder their derision; so that, after he had endeavoured to compose\\r\\nhimself by taking snuff and forcing a smile, he was obliged to sneak\\r\\noff in a ludicrous attitude, while my Dulcinea was applauded to the\\r\\nskies for the brilliancy of her wit, and her acquaintance immediately\\r\\ncourted by the best people of both sexes in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis event, with which I was indefinitely pleased at first, did not\\r\\nfail of alarming me, upon further reflection, when I considered, that\\r\\nthe more she was caressed by persons of distinction, the more her pride\\r\\nwould be inflamed, and consequently, the obstacles to my success\\r\\nmultiplied and enlarged. Nor were my presaging fears untrue. That very\\r\\nnight I perceived her a little intoxicated with the incense she had\\r\\nreceived, and, though, she still behaved with a particular civility to\\r\\nme, I foresaw, that, as soon as her fortune should be known, she would\\r\\nbe surrounded with a swarm of admirers, some of whom might possibly, by\\r\\nexcelling me on point of wealth, or in the arts of flattery and\\r\\nscandal, supplant me in her esteem, and find means to make the mother\\r\\nof his party. I resolved therefore to lose no time, and, being invited\\r\\nto spend the evening with them, found an opportunity, in spite of the\\r\\nold gentlewomanâ\\x80\\x99s vigilance, to explain the meaning of my glances in\\r\\nthe coach, by paying homage to her wit, and professing myself enamoured\\r\\nof her person. She blushed at my declaration and in a favourable manner\\r\\ndisapproved of the liberty I had taken, putting me in mind of our being\\r\\nstrangers to each other, and desiring I would not be the means of\\r\\ninterrupting our acquaintance, by any such unseasonable strokes of\\r\\ngallantry for the future. My ardour was effectually checked by this\\r\\nreprimand, which was, however, delivered in a gentle manner, that I had\\r\\nno cause to be disobliged; and the arrival of her mother relieved me\\r\\nfrom a dilemma in which I should not have known how to demean myself a\\r\\nminute longer. Neither could I resume the easiness of carriage with\\r\\nwhich I came in; my mistress acted on the reserve, and the conversation\\r\\nbeginning to flag, the old lady introduced her kinswoman of the house,\\r\\nand proposed a hand at whist.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we amused ourselves at this diversion, I understood from the\\r\\ngentlewoman, that there was to be an assembly next night at which I\\r\\nbegged to have the honour of dancing with Miss. She thanked me for the\\r\\nfavour I intended her, assured me she never did dance, but signified a\\r\\ndesire of seeing the company, when I offered my service, which was\\r\\naccepted, not a little proud of being exempted from appearing with her\\r\\nin a situation, that, notwithstanding my profession to the contrary,\\r\\nwas not at all agreeable to my inclination.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving supped, and continued the game, till such time as the successive\\r\\nyawns of the mother warned me to be gone, I took my leave, and went\\r\\nhome, where I made Strap very happy with an account of my progress.\\r\\nNext day I put on my gayest apparel, and went to drink tea at Mrs.\\r\\nSnapperâ\\x80\\x99s, according to appointment, when I found, to my inexpressible\\r\\nsatisfaction, that she was laid up with the toothache, and that Miss\\r\\nwas to be intrusted to my care. Accordingly, we set out for the\\r\\nball-room pretty early in the evening, and took possession of a\\r\\ncommodious place, where we had not sat longer than a quarter of an\\r\\nhour, when a gentleman, dressed in a green frock, came in, leading a\\r\\nyoung lady, whom I immediately discovered to be the adorable Narcissa!\\r\\nGood heaven! what were the thrillings of my soul at that instant! my\\r\\nreflection was overwhelmed with a torrent of agitation! my heart\\r\\nthrobbed with surprising violence! a sudden mist overspread my eyes, my\\r\\nears were invaded with a dreadful sound! I panted for want of breath,\\r\\nand, in short, was for some moments entranced! This first tumult\\r\\nsubsiding, a crowd of flattering ideas rushed upon my imagination.\\r\\nEverything, that was soft, sensible, and engaging, in the character of\\r\\nthat dear creature recurred to my remembrance, and every favourable\\r\\ncircumstance of my own qualifications appeared in all the aggravation\\r\\nof self-conceit, to heighten my expectation! Neither was this transport\\r\\nof long duration. The dread of her being already disposed of\\r\\nintervened, and overcast my enchanting reverie! My presaging\\r\\napprehension represented her encircled in the arms of some happy rival,\\r\\nand in consequence for ever lost to me. I was stung with this\\r\\nsuggestion, and, believing the person who conducted her to be the\\r\\nhusband of this amiable young lady, already devoted him to my fury, and\\r\\nstood up to mark him for my vengeance, when I recollected, to my\\r\\nunspeakable joy, her brother the fox-hunter, in the person of her\\r\\ngallant.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndeceived so much to my satisfaction in this particular, I gazed in a\\r\\nfrenzy of delight on the irresistible charms of his sister, who no\\r\\nsooner distinguished me in the crowd, than her evident confusion\\r\\nafforded a happy omen to my flame. At sight of me she started, the\\r\\nroses instantly vanished from her polished cheeks, and returned in a\\r\\nmoment with a double glow, that overspread her lovely neck, while her\\r\\nenchanting bosom heaved with strong emotion. I hailed these favourable\\r\\nsymptoms, and, lying in wait for her looks, did homage with my eyes.\\r\\nShe seemed to approve my declaration, by the complacency of her aspect;\\r\\nand I was so transported with the discovery, that more than once I was\\r\\non the point of making up to her, to disclose the throbbings of my\\r\\nheart in person, had not that profound veneration, which her presence\\r\\nalways inspired, restrained the unseasonable impulse. All my powers\\r\\nbeing engrossed in this manner, it may easily be imagined how ill I\\r\\nentertained Miss Snapper on whom I could not now turn my eyes, without\\r\\nmaking comparisons very little to her advantage. It was not even in my\\r\\npower to return distinct answers to the questions she asked from time\\r\\nto time, so that she could not help observing my absence of mind; and\\r\\nhaving a turn for observation, watched my glances, and, tracing them to\\r\\nthe divine object, discovered the cause of my disorder. That she might,\\r\\nhowever, be convinced of the truth of her conjecture, she began to\\r\\ninterrogate me with regard to Narcissa, and, notwithstanding all my\\r\\nendeavours to disguise my sentiments, perceived my attachment by my\\r\\nconfusion: upon which, she assumed a stateliness of behaviour, and sat\\r\\nsilent during the remaining part of the entertainment. At any other\\r\\ntime, her suspicion would have alarmed me: but now I was elevated by my\\r\\npassion above every other consideration. The mistress of my soul having\\r\\nretired with her brother, I discovered so much uneasiness at my\\r\\nsituation, that Miss Snapper proposed to go home; and, while I\\r\\nconducted her to a chair, told me she had too great a regard for me to\\r\\nkeep me any longer in torment. I feigned ignorance of her meaning, and\\r\\nhaving seen her safely at her lodgings, took my leave, and went home in\\r\\nan ecstasy, where I disclosed everything that had happened to my\\r\\nconfidant and humble servant, Strap, who did not relish the accident so\\r\\nwell as I expected; and observed, that a bird in the hand is worth two\\r\\nin the bush. â\\x80\\x9cBut, however,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cyou know bestâ\\x80\\x94you know best.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nNext day, as, I went to the Pump Room, in hopes of seeing or hearing\\r\\nsome tidings of my fair enslaver, I was met by a gentlewoman, who,\\r\\nhaving looked hard at me, cried, â\\x80\\x9cO Christ, Mr. Random!â\\x80\\x9d Surprised at\\r\\nthis exclamation, I examined the countenance of the person who spoke,\\r\\nand immediately recognised my old sweetheart and fellow sufferer, Miss\\r\\nWilliams.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was mightily pleased to find this unfortunate woman under such a\\r\\ndecent appearance, professed my joy at seeing her so well, and desired\\r\\nto know where I should have the pleasure of her conversation. She was\\r\\nas heartily rejoiced at the apparent easiness of my fortune, and gave\\r\\nme to know that she, as yet, had no habitation that she could properly\\r\\ncall her own; but would wait on me at any place I should please to\\r\\nappoint. Understanding that she was unengaged for the present, I showed\\r\\nher the way to my lodgings, where, after a very affectionate\\r\\nsalutation, she informed me of her being very happy in the service of a\\r\\nyoung lady to whom she was recommended by a former mistress deceased,\\r\\ninto whose family she had recommended herself by the honest deceit she\\r\\nhad concerted, while she lived with me in the garret at London. She\\r\\nthen expressed a vehement desire to be acquainted with the vicissitudes\\r\\nof my life since we parted, and excused her curiosity on account of the\\r\\nconcern she had for my interest. I forthwith gratified her request,\\r\\nand, when I described my situation in Sussex, perceived her to attend\\r\\nto my story with particular eagerness. She interrupted me, when I had\\r\\nfinished that period, with, â\\x80\\x9cGood God! is it possible?â\\x80\\x9d and then begged\\r\\nI would be so good as to continue my relation; which I did as briefly\\r\\nas I could, burning with impatience to know the cause of her surprise,\\r\\nabout which I had already formed a very interesting conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had brought my adventures down to the present day, who seemed\\r\\nvery much affected with the different circumstances of my fortune; and\\r\\nsaying, with a smile, she believed my distresses were now at a period,\\r\\nproceeded to inform me that the lady whom she served was no other than\\r\\nthe charming Narcissa, who had honoured her with her confidence for\\r\\nsome time; in consequence of which trust, she had often repeated the\\r\\nstory of John Brown with great admiration and regard; that she loved to\\r\\ndwell upon the particulars of his character, and did not scruple to own\\r\\na tender approbation of his flame. I became delirious at this piece of\\r\\nintelligence, strained Miss Williams in my embrace, called her the\\r\\nangel of my happiness, and acted such extravagances, that she might\\r\\nhave been convinced of my sincerity, had she not been satisfied of my\\r\\nhonour before. As soon as was in condition to yield attention, she\\r\\ndescribed the present situation of her mistress, who had no sooner\\r\\nreached her lodgings the night before, than she closeted her, and in a\\r\\nrapture of joy gave her to know that she had seen me at the ball, where\\r\\nI appeared in the character which she always thought my due, with such\\r\\nadvantage of transformation that, unless my image had been engraven on\\r\\nher heart, it would have been impossible to know me for the person who\\r\\nhad worn her auntâ\\x80\\x99s livery; that by the language of my eyes, she was\\r\\nassured of the continuance of my passion for her, and consequently of\\r\\nmy being unengaged to any other; and that, though she did not doubt I\\r\\nwould speedily fall upon some method of being introduced, she was so\\r\\nimpatient to hear of me, that she (Miss Williams) had been sent abroad\\r\\nthis very morning, on purpose to learn the name and character I at\\r\\npresent bore. My bosom had been hitherto a stranger to such a flood of\\r\\njoy as now rushed upon it; my faculties were overborne by the tide; it\\r\\nwas some time before I could open my mouth, and much longer ere I could\\r\\nutter a coherent sentence. At length, I fervently requested her to lead\\r\\nme immediately to the object of my adoration; but she resisted my\\r\\nimportunity, and explained the danger of such premature conduct. â\\x80\\x9cHow\\r\\nfavourable soever,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cmy ladyâ\\x80\\x99s inclination towards you may\\r\\nbe, you may depend upon it, she will not commit the smallest trespass\\r\\non decorum, either in disclosing her own, or in receiving a declaration\\r\\nof your passion: and, although the great veneration I have for you has\\r\\nprompted me to reveal what she communicated to me in confidence, I know\\r\\nso well the severity of her sentiments with respect to the punctilios\\r\\nof her sex that, if she should learn the least surmise of it, she would\\r\\nnot only dismiss me as a wretch unworthy of her benevolence, but also\\r\\nfor ever shun the efforts of your love.â\\x80\\x9d I assented to the justness of\\r\\nher remonstrance, and desired she would assist me with her advice and\\r\\ndirection: upon which it was concerted between us, that for the present\\r\\nI should be contented with her telling Narcissa that, in the course of\\r\\nher inquiries, she could only learn my name: and that, if, in a day or\\r\\ntwo, I could fall upon no other method of being introduced to her\\r\\nmistress, she would deliver a letter from me, on pretence of consulting\\r\\nher happiness: and say that I met her in the streets, and bribed her to\\r\\nthis piece of service. Matters being thus adjusted, I kept my old\\r\\nacquaintance to breakfast, and learned from her conversation, that my\\r\\nrival Sir Timothy had drunk himself into an apoplexy, of which he died\\r\\nfive months ago; that the savage was still unmarried and that his aunt\\r\\nhad been seized with a whim which he little expected, and chosen the\\r\\nschoolmaster of the parish for her lord and husband: but matrimony not\\r\\nagreeing with her constitution she had been hectic and dropsical a good\\r\\nwhile, and was now at Bath, in order to drink the waters for the\\r\\nrecovery of her health; that her niece had accompanied her thither at\\r\\nher request, and attended her with the same affection as before,\\r\\nnotwithstanding the mistake she had committed: and that the nephew, who\\r\\nhad been exasperated at the loss of her fortune, did not give his\\r\\nattendance out of good will, but purely to have an eye on his sister,\\r\\nlest she should likewise throw herself away without his consent or\\r\\napprobation. Having enjoyed ourselves in this manner, and made an\\r\\nassignation to meet next day at a certain place, Miss Williams took her\\r\\nleave; and Strapâ\\x80\\x99s looks being very inquisitive about the nature of the\\r\\ncommunication subsisting between us, I made him acquainted with the\\r\\nwhole affair, to his great astonishment and satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI become acquainted with Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s brother, who invites me to his\\r\\nHouse, where I am introduced to that adorable Creatureâ\\x80\\x94after dinner,\\r\\nthe Squire retires to take his napâ\\x80\\x94Freeman, guessing the Situation of\\r\\nmy Thought, withdraws likewise, on pretence of Businessâ\\x80\\x94I declare my\\r\\npassion for Narcissaâ\\x80\\x94am well-receivedâ\\x80\\x94charmed with her Conversationâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nSquire detains us to Supperâ\\x80\\x94I elude his design by a Stratagem, and get\\r\\nhome sober\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon, I drank tea at the house of Mr. Freeman, to whom I\\r\\nhad been recommended by Banter; where I had not sat five minutes, till\\r\\nthe foxhunter came in, and by his familiar behaviour appeared to be\\r\\nintimate with my friend. I was, at first, under some concern, lest he\\r\\nshould recollect my features; but when I found myself introduced to him\\r\\nas a gentleman from London, without being discovered, I blessed the\\r\\nopportunity that brought me into his company; hoping that, in the\\r\\ncourse of my acquaintance, he would invite me to his house; nor were my\\r\\nhopes frustrated, for, as we spent the evening together, he grew\\r\\nextremely fond of my conversation, asked a great many childish\\r\\nquestions about France and foreign parts; and seemed so highly\\r\\nentertained with my answers, that in his cups he shook me often by the\\r\\nhand, pronounced me an honest fellow, and in fine desired our company\\r\\nat dinner next day, at his civil house. My imagination was so much\\r\\nemployed in anticipating the happiness I was to enjoy next day, that I\\r\\nslept very little that night; but, rising early in the morning, went to\\r\\nthe place appointed, where I met my she-friend, and imparted to her my\\r\\nsuccess with the squire. She was very much pleased at the occasion,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9ccould not fail of being agreeable to Narcissa, who,\\r\\nin spite of her passion for me, had mentioned some scruples relating to\\r\\nmy true situation and character, which the delicacy of her sentiments\\r\\nsuggested, and which she believed I would find it necessary to remove,\\r\\nthough she did not know how.â\\x80\\x9d I was a good deal startled at this\\r\\ninsinuation, because I foresaw the difficulty I should find in barely\\r\\ndoing myself justice: for, although it never was my intention to impose\\r\\nmyself upon any woman, much less on Narcissa, I laid claim to the\\r\\ncharacter of a gentleman by birth, education, and behaviour; and yet\\r\\n(so unlucky had the circumstances of my life fallen out) I should find\\r\\nit a very hard matter to make good my pretensions even to these,\\r\\nespecially to the last, which was the most essential. Miss Williams was\\r\\nas sensible as I of this my disadvantage, but comforted me with\\r\\nobserving that, when once a woman has bestowed her affections on a man,\\r\\nshe cannot help judging of him in all respects with a partiality easily\\r\\ninfluenced in his favour: she remarked that, although some situations\\r\\nof my life had been low, yet none of them had been infamous; that my\\r\\nindigence had been the crime not of me, but of fortune; and that the\\r\\nmiseries I had undergone, by improving the faculties both of mind and\\r\\nbody, qualified me the more for any dignified station; and would of\\r\\nconsequence recommend me to the good graces of any sensible woman: she\\r\\ntherefore advised me to be always open and unreserved to the inquiries\\r\\nof my mistress, without unnecessarily betraying the meanest occurrences\\r\\nof my fate; and trust to the strength of her love and reflection for\\r\\nthe rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sentiments of this sensible young woman on this, as well as on\\r\\nalmost every other subject, perfectly agreed with mine. I thanked her\\r\\nfor the care she took of my interests, and, promising to behave myself\\r\\naccording to her directions we parted, after she had assured me that I\\r\\ndepend upon her best offices with her mistress, and that she would from\\r\\ntime to time communicate to me such intelligence as she could procure,\\r\\nrelating to my flame. Having dressed myself to the best advantage, I\\r\\nwaited for the time of dinner with the most fearful impatience; and, as\\r\\nthe hour drew near, my heart beat with such increased velocity, and my\\r\\nspirits contracted such disorder, that I began to suspect my\\r\\nresolution, and even to wish myself disengaged. At last Mr. Freeman\\r\\ncalled at my lodgings in his way, and I accompanied him to the house\\r\\nwhere all my happiness was deposited. We were very kindly received by\\r\\nthe squire, who sat smoking his pipe in a parlour, and asked if we\\r\\nchose to drink any thing before dinner: though I never had more\\r\\noccasion for a cordial, I was ashamed to accept his offer, which was\\r\\nalso refused, by my friend. We sat down, however, entered into\\r\\nconversation, which lasted half-an hour, so that I had time to\\r\\nrecollect myself; and (so capricious were my thoughts) even to hope\\r\\nthat Narcissa would not appearâ\\x80\\x94when, all of a sudden, a servant coming\\r\\nin, gave us notice that dinner was upon the table, and my perturbation\\r\\nreturned with such violence that I could scarcely conceal it from the\\r\\ncompany, as I ascended the staircase. When I entered the dining-room,\\r\\nthe first object that saluted my ravished eyes was the divine Narcissa,\\r\\nblushing like Aurora, adorned with all the graces that meekness,\\r\\ninnocence, and beauty can diffuse! I was seized with a giddiness, my\\r\\nknees tottered and I scarce had strength enough to perform the ceremony\\r\\nof salutation, when her brother, slapping me on the shoulder, cried,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMeasure Randan, that there is my sister.â\\x80\\x9d I approached her with\\r\\neagerness and fear; but in the moment of our embrace, my soul was\\r\\nagonized with rapture! It was a lucky circumstance for us both, that my\\r\\nentertainer was not endued with an uncommon stock of penetration; for\\r\\nour mutual confusion was so manifest that Mr. Freeman perceived it, and\\r\\nas we went home together, congratulated me on my good fortune. But so\\r\\nfar was Bruin from entertaining the least suspicion, that he encouraged\\r\\nme to begin a conversation with my mistress in a language unknown to\\r\\nhim, by telling her, that he had a gentleman who could jabber with her\\r\\nin French and other foreign lingoes as fast as she pleased; then,\\r\\nturning to me, said, â\\x80\\x9cOdds bobs! I wish you would hold discourse with\\r\\nher in your French or Italian, and tell me if she understands it as\\r\\nwell as she would be thought to do. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s her aunt and she will\\r\\nchatter together whole days in it, and I canâ\\x80\\x99t have a mouthful of\\r\\nEnglish for love or money.â\\x80\\x9d I consulted the look of my amiable mistress\\r\\nand found her averse to his proposal, which indeed she declined with a\\r\\nsweetness of denial peculiar to herself, as a piece of disrespect to\\r\\nthat part of the company which did not understand the language in\\r\\nquestion. As I had the happiness of sitting opposite to her, I feasted\\r\\nmy eyes much more than my palate which she tempted in vain with the\\r\\nmost delicious bits carved by her fair hand, and recommended by her\\r\\npersuasive tongue; but all my other appetites were swallowed up in\\r\\nimmensity of my love, which I fed by gazing incessantly on the\\r\\ndelightful object. Dinner was scarcely ended, when the squire became\\r\\nvery drowsy, and after several dreadful yawns, got up, stretched\\r\\nhimself, took two or three turns across the room, begged we would allow\\r\\nhim to take a short nap, and, having laid a strong injunction on his\\r\\nsister to detain us till his return, went to his repose without further\\r\\nceremony. He had not been gone many minutes, when Freeman, guessing the\\r\\nsituation of my heart, and thinking he could not do me a greater favour\\r\\nthan to leave me alone with Narcissa, pretended to recollect himself\\r\\nall of a sudden, and, starting up, begged the lady pardon for\\r\\nhalf-an-hour, for he had unluckily remembered an engagement of some\\r\\nconsequence, that he must perform at that instant: so saying, he took\\r\\nhis leave, promising to come back time enough for tea, leaving my\\r\\nmistress and me in great confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that I enjoyed an opportunity of disclosing the paintings of my\\r\\nsoul, I had not the power to use it. I studied many pathetic\\r\\ndeclarations, but, when I attempted to give them utterance, my tongue\\r\\ndenied its office and she sat silent with a downcast look full of\\r\\nanxious alarm, her bosom heaving with expectation of some great event.\\r\\nAt length I endeavoured to put an end to this solemn pause, and began\\r\\nwith, â\\x80\\x9cIt is very surprising, madam, madamâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94here the sound dying away,\\r\\nI made a full stop; while Narcissa, starting, blushed, and, with a\\r\\ntimid accent answered, â\\x80\\x9cSir?â\\x80\\x9d Confounded at this note of interrogation,\\r\\nI pronounced with the most sheepish bashfulness, â\\x80\\x9cMadam!â\\x80\\x9d To which she\\r\\nreplied, â\\x80\\x9cI beg pardonâ\\x80\\x94I thought you had spoken to me.â\\x80\\x9d Another pause\\r\\nensuedâ\\x80\\x94I made another effort, and, though my voice faltered very much\\r\\nat the beginning, made shift to express myself in this manner: â\\x80\\x9cI say,\\r\\nmadam, it is very surprising that love should act so inconsistently\\r\\nwith itself, as to deprive its votaries of the use of their faculties,\\r\\nwhen they have most need of them. Since the happy occasion of being\\r\\nalone with you presented itself, I have made many unsuccessful attempts\\r\\nto declare a passion for the loveliest of her sexâ\\x80\\x94a passion which took\\r\\npossession of my soul, while my cruel fate compelled me to wear a\\r\\nservile disguise so unsuitable to my birth, sentiments, and let me add,\\r\\nmy deserts; yet favourable in one respect, as it furnished me with\\r\\nopportunities of seeing and adoring your perfections. Yes, madam, it\\r\\nwas then your dear idea entered my bosom, where it has lived unimpaired\\r\\nin the midst of numberless cares, and animated me against a thousand\\r\\ndangers and calamities!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I spoke thus, she concealed her face with her fan, and when I\\r\\nceased speaking, recovering herself from the most beautiful confusion,\\r\\ntold me she thought herself very much obliged by my favourable opinion\\r\\nof her, and that she was very sorry to hear I had been unfortunate.\\r\\nEncouraged by this gentle reply, I proceeded, owned myself sufficiently\\r\\nrecompensed by her kind compassion for what I had undergone, and\\r\\ndeclared the future happiness of my life depended solely upon her.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x9d said she, â\\x80\\x9cI should be very ungrateful, if after the signal\\r\\nprotection you once afforded me, I should refuse to contribute towards\\r\\nyour happiness in any reasonable condescension.â\\x80\\x9d Transported at this\\r\\nacknowledgment I threw myself at her feet, and begged she would regard\\r\\nmy passion with a favourable eye. She was alarmed at my behaviour,\\r\\nentreated me to rise lest her brother should discover me in that\\r\\nposture, and to spare her for the present upon a subject for which she\\r\\nwas altogether unprepared. In consequence of this remonstrance, I rose,\\r\\nassuring her I would rather die than disobey her: but in the meantime\\r\\nbegged her to consider how precious the minutes of this opportunity\\r\\nwere, and what restraint I put upon my inclinations, in sacrificing\\r\\nthem to her desire. She smiled with unspeakable sweetness, and said\\r\\nthere would be no want of opportunities, provided I could maintain the\\r\\ngood opinion her brother had conceived of me, and I, enchanted by her\\r\\ncharms, seized her hand, which I well nigh devoured with kisses. But\\r\\nshe checked my boldness with a severity of countenance, and desired I\\r\\nwould not so far forget myself to her, as to endanger the esteem she\\r\\nhad for me; she reminded me of our being almost strangers to each\\r\\nother, and of the necessity there was for her knowing me better, before\\r\\nshe could take any resolution in my favour; and, in short, mingled so\\r\\nmuch good sense and complacency in her reproof, that I became as much\\r\\nenamoured of her understanding as I had been before of her beauty, and\\r\\nasked pardon for my presumption with the utmost reverence of\\r\\nconviction. She forgave my offence with her usual affability, and\\r\\nsealed my pardon with a look so full of bewitching tenderness, that,\\r\\nfor some minutes, my senses were lost in ecstacy! I afterwards\\r\\nendeavoured to regulate my behaviour according to her desire, and turn\\r\\nthe conversation upon a more indifferent subject; but her presence was\\r\\nan insurmountable obstacle to my design; while I beheld so much\\r\\nexcellence, I found it impossible to call my attention from the\\r\\ncontemplation of it! I gazed with unutterable fondness! I grew mad with\\r\\nadmiration! â\\x80\\x9cMy condition is insupportable!â\\x80\\x9d cried I: â\\x80\\x9cI am distracted\\r\\nwith passion! Why are you so exquisitely fair?â\\x80\\x94why are you so\\r\\nenchantingly good?â\\x80\\x94why has nature dignified you with charms so much\\r\\nabove the standard of woman? and, wretch that I am, how dare my\\r\\nunworthiness aspire to the enjoyment of such perfection!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was startled at my ravings, reasoned down my transport, and by her\\r\\nirresistible eloquence, soothed my soul into a state of tranquil\\r\\nfelicity; but, lest I might suffer a relapse, industriously promoted\\r\\nother subjects to entertain my imagination. She chid me for having\\r\\nomitted to inquire about her aunt who (she assured me), in the midst of\\r\\nall her absence of temper, and detachment from common affairs, often\\r\\ntalked of me with uncommon warmth. I professed my veneration for the\\r\\ngood lady, excused my omission, by imputing it to the violence of my\\r\\nlove, which engrossed my whole soul, and desired to know the situation\\r\\nof her health. Upon which, the amiable Narcissa repeated what I had\\r\\nheard before of her marriage, with all the tenderness for her\\r\\nreputation that the subject would admit of; told me she lived with her\\r\\nhusband hard by, and was so much afflicted with the dropsy, and wasted\\r\\nby a consumption, that she had small hopes of her recovery. Having\\r\\nexpressed my sorrow for her distemper, I questioned her about my good\\r\\nfriend, Mrs. Sagely, who, I learned to my great satisfaction, was in\\r\\ngood health, and who had by the encomiums she bestowed upon me after I\\r\\nwas gone, confirmed the favourable impression my behaviour at parting\\r\\nhad made on Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s heart. This circumstance introduced an inquiry\\r\\ninto the conduct of Sir Timothy Thicket, who (she informed me) had\\r\\nfound means to incense her brother so much against me that she found it\\r\\nimpossible to undeceive him: but, on the contrary, suffered very much\\r\\nin her own character by his scandalous insinuations; that the whole\\r\\nparish was alarmed, and actually in pursuit of me; so that she had been\\r\\nin the utmost consternation on my account, well knowing how little my\\r\\nown innocence and her testimony would have weighed with the ignorance,\\r\\nprejudice, and brutality of those who must have judged me, had I been\\r\\napprehended; that Sir Timothy, having been seized with a fit of\\r\\napoplexy, from which with great difficulty he was recovered, began to\\r\\nbe apprehensive of death, and to prepare himself accordingly for that\\r\\ngreat event; as a step to which he sent for her brother, owned with\\r\\ngreat contrition the brutal design he had upon her, and in consequence\\r\\nacquitted me of the assault, robbery, and correspondence with her,\\r\\nwhich he had laid to my charge; after which confession he lived about a\\r\\nmonth in a languishing condition, and was carried off by a second\\r\\nassault.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery word that this dear creature spoke, riveted the chains with which\\r\\nshe held me enslaved! My mischievous fancy began to work, and the\\r\\ntempest of my passion to wake again, when the return of Freeman\\r\\ndestroyed the tempting opportunity, and enabled me to quell the rising\\r\\ntumult. A little while after, the squire staggered into the room,\\r\\nrubbing his eyes, and called for his tea, which he drank out of a small\\r\\nbowl, qualified with brandy; while we took it in the usual way,\\r\\nNarcissa left us in order to visit her aunt; and when Freeman and I\\r\\nproposed to take our leave, the foxhunter insisted on our spending the\\r\\nevening at his house with such obstinacy of affection, that we were\\r\\nobliged to comply. For my own part, I should have been glad of the\\r\\ninvitation, by which, in all likelihood, I should be blessed with more\\r\\nof his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s company, had I not been afraid of risking her esteem,\\r\\nby entering into a debauch of drinking with him, which, from the\\r\\nknowledge of his character, I foresaw would happen: but there was no\\r\\nremedy. I was forced to rely upon the strength of my constitution,\\r\\nwhich I hoped would resist intoxication longer than the squireâ\\x80\\x99s, and\\r\\nto trust to the good nature and discretion of my mistress for the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur entertainer, resolving to begin by times, ordered the table to be\\r\\nfurnished with liquor and glasses immediately after tea, but we\\r\\nabsolutely refused to set in for drinking so soon; and prevailed upon\\r\\nhim to pass away an hour or two at whist, in which we engaged as soon\\r\\nas Narcissa returned. The savage and I happened to be partners at\\r\\nfirst, and, as my thoughts were wholly employed in a more interesting\\r\\ngame, I played so ill that he lost all patience, swore bitterly, and\\r\\nthreatened to call for wine, if they would not grant him another\\r\\nassociate. This desire was gratified, and Narcissa and I were of a\\r\\nside; he won for the same reason that made him lose before; I was\\r\\nsatisfied, my lovely partner did not repine, and the time slipped away\\r\\nvery agreeably, until we were told that supper was served in another\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe squire was enraged to find the evening so unprofitably spent, and\\r\\nwreaked his vengeance on the cards, which he tore, and committed to the\\r\\nflames with many execrations; threatening to make us redeem our loss\\r\\nwith a large glass and quick circulation; and indeed we had no sooner\\r\\nsupped, and my charmer withdrawn, than he began to put his threat in\\r\\nexecution. Three bottles of port (for he drank no other sort of wine)\\r\\nwere placed before us, with as many water glasses, which were\\r\\nimmediately filled to the brim, after his example, by each out of his\\r\\nrespective allowance, and emptied in a trice to the best in\\r\\nChristendom. Though I swallowed this, and the next, as fast as the\\r\\nglass could be replenished, without hesitation or show of reluctance, I\\r\\nperceived that my brain would not be able to bear many bumpers of this\\r\\nsort, and dreading the perseverance of a champion who began with such\\r\\nvigour, I determined to make up for the deficiency of my strength by a\\r\\nstratagem, which I actually put in practice when the second course of\\r\\nbottles was called for. The wine being strong and heady, I was already\\r\\na good deal discomposed by the dispatch we had made. Freemanâ\\x80\\x99s eyes\\r\\nbegan to reel, and Bruin himself was elevated into a song, which he\\r\\nuttered with great vociferation. When I therefore saw the second round\\r\\nbrought in, I assumed a gay air, entertained him with a French catch on\\r\\nthe subject of drinking, which, though he did rot understand it,\\r\\ndelighted him highly; and, telling him your choice spirits at Paris\\r\\nnever troubled themselves with glasses, asked if he had not a bowl or\\r\\ncup in the house that would contain a whole quart of wine. â\\x80\\x9cOdds\\r\\nniggers!â\\x80\\x9d cried he, â\\x80\\x9cI have a silver candle cup that holds just the\\r\\nquantity, for all the world; fetch it hither, Numps.â\\x80\\x9d The vessel being\\r\\nproduced, I bade him decant his bottle into it, which he having done, I\\r\\nnodded in a very deliberate manner, and said, â\\x80\\x9cPledge you.â\\x80\\x9d He stared\\r\\nat me for some time, and crying, â\\x80\\x9cWhat! all at one pull, Measter\\r\\nRandan?â\\x80\\x9d I answered, â\\x80\\x9cAt one pull, Sir, you are no milk-sopâ\\x80\\x94we shall do\\r\\nyou justice.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cShall you?â\\x80\\x9d said he, shaking me by the hand; â\\x80\\x9codds then,\\r\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll see it out, anâ\\x80\\x99t were a mile to the bottom: hereâ\\x80\\x99s to our better\\r\\nacquaintance, measter Randan,â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he applied it to his lips,\\r\\nand emptied it in a breath. I knew the effect of it would be almost\\r\\ninstantaneous; therefore taking the cup, began to discharge my bottle\\r\\ninto it, telling him he was now qualified to drink with the Cham of\\r\\nTartary. I had no sooner pronounced these words than he took umbrage at\\r\\nthem, and after several attempts to spit, made shift to stutter, â\\x80\\x9cA fâ\\x80\\x94t\\r\\nfor your Chams of Tâ\\x80\\x94Tartary! I am a fâ\\x80\\x94fâ\\x80\\x94freeborn Englishman, worth\\r\\nthâ\\x80\\x94three thousand a-year, and vâ\\x80\\x94value no man, dâ\\x80\\x94me.â\\x80\\x9d Then, dropping his\\r\\njaw, and fixing his eyes, he hiccuped aloud, and fell upon the floor as\\r\\nmute as a flounder. Mr. Freeman, heartily glad at his defeat, assisted\\r\\nme in carrying him to bed, where we left him to the care of his\\r\\nservants, and went home to our respective habitations, congratulating\\r\\neach other on our good fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Williams informs me of Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s Approbation of my Flameâ\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nappease the Squireâ\\x80\\x94write to my Mistressâ\\x80\\x94am blessed with an Answerâ\\x80\\x94beg\\r\\nLeave of her Brother to dance with her at a Ballâ\\x80\\x94obtain his Consent and\\r\\nhersâ\\x80\\x94enjoy a private Conversation with herâ\\x80\\x94am perplexed with\\r\\nReflectionsâ\\x80\\x94have the Honour of appearing her Partner at a Ballâ\\x80\\x94we are\\r\\ncomplimented by a certain Noblemanâ\\x80\\x94he discovers some Symptoms of a\\r\\nPassion for Narcissaâ\\x80\\x94I am stung with Jealousyâ\\x80\\x94Narcissa, alarmed,\\r\\nretiresâ\\x80\\x94I observe Melinda in the companyâ\\x80\\x94the Squire is captivated by\\r\\nher Beauty\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI was met next morning at the usual place by Miss Williams, who gave me\\r\\njoy of the progress I had made in the affection of her mistress, and\\r\\nblessed me with an account of that dear creatureâ\\x80\\x99s conversation with\\r\\nher, after she had retired the night before from our company. I could\\r\\nscarce believe her information, when she recounted her expressions in\\r\\nmy favour, so much more warm and passionate were they than my most\\r\\nsanguine hopes had presaged; and was particularly pleased to hear that\\r\\nshe approved of my behaviour to her brother after she withdrew.\\r\\nTransported at the news of my happiness, I presented my ring to the\\r\\nmessenger as a testimony of my gratitude and satisfaction; but she was\\r\\nabove such mercenary considerations, and refused my compliment with\\r\\nsome resentment, saying, she was not a little mortified to see my\\r\\nopinion of her so low and contemptible. I did myself a piece of justice\\r\\nby explaining my behaviour on this head, and to convince her of my\\r\\nesteem, promised to be ruled by her directions in the prosecution of\\r\\nthe whole affair, which I had so much at heart, that the repose of my\\r\\nlife depended upon the consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I fervently wished for another interview, where I might pour out the\\r\\neffusion of my love without danger of being interrupted, and perhaps\\r\\nreap some endearing return from the queen of my desires, I implored her\\r\\nadvice and assistance in promoting this event: but she gave me to\\r\\nunderstand, that Narcissa would make no precipitate compliances of this\\r\\nkind, and I would do well to cultivate her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s acquaintance, in\\r\\nthe course of which I should not want opportunities of removing that\\r\\nreserve which my mistress thought herself obliged to maintain during\\r\\nthe infancy of our correspondence. In the meantime she promised to tell\\r\\nher lady that I had endeavoured by presents and persuasions, to prevail\\r\\nupon her (Miss Williams) to deliver a letter from me, which she had\\r\\nrefused to charge herself with, until she should know Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsentiments of the matter; and said, by these means she did not doubt of\\r\\nbeing able to open a literary communication between us, which could not\\r\\nfail of introducing more intimate connections.\\r\\n\\r\\nI approved of her counsel, and, our appointment being renewed for the\\r\\nnext day, left her with an intent of falling upon some method of being\\r\\nreconciled to the squire, who, I supposed, would be offended with the\\r\\ntrick we had put upon him. With this view I consulted Freeman, who,\\r\\nfrom his knowledge of the foxhunterâ\\x80\\x99s disposition, assured me there was\\r\\nno other method of pacifying him, than that of sacrificing ourselves\\r\\nfor one night to an equal match with him in drinking. This expedient I\\r\\nfound myself necessitated to comply with for the interest of my\\r\\npassion, and therefore determined to commit the debauch at my own\\r\\nlodgings, that I might run no risk of being discovered by Narcissa, in\\r\\na state of brutal degeneracy. Mr. Freeman, who was to be of the party,\\r\\nwent, at my desire, to the squire, in order to engage him, while I took\\r\\ncare to furnish myself for his reception. My invitation was accepted,\\r\\nmy guests honoured me with their company in the evening, when Bruin\\r\\ngave me to understand that he had drunk many tons of wine in his life,\\r\\nbut was never served such a trick as I had played upon him the night\\r\\nbefore. I promised to atone for my trespass, and, having ordered to\\r\\nevery man his bottle, began the contest with a bumper to the health of\\r\\nNarcissa. The toasts circulated with great devotion, the liquor began\\r\\nto operate, our mirth grew noisy, and, as Freeman said, I had the\\r\\nadvantage of drinking small French claret, the savage was effectually\\r\\ntamed before our senses were in the least affected, and carried home in\\r\\nan apoplexy of drunkenness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was next morning, as usual, favoured with a visit from my kind and\\r\\npunctual confidante, who, telling me she was permitted to receive my\\r\\nletters for her mistress, I took up the pen immediately, and, following\\r\\nthe first dictates of my passion, wrote as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDear Madam,\\r\\n    â\\x80\\x9cWere it possible for the powers of utterance to reveal the soft\\r\\n    emotions of my soul, the fond anxiety, the glowing hopes, the\\r\\n    chilling flame, that rule my breast by turns, I should need no\\r\\n    other witness than this paper, to evince the purity and ardour of\\r\\n    that flame your charms have kindled in my heart, But alas!\\r\\n    expression wrongs my love! I am inspired with conceptions that no\\r\\n    language can convey! Your beauty fills me with wonder, your\\r\\n    understanding with ravishment, and your goodness with adoration! I\\r\\n    am transported with desire, distracted with doubts, and tortured\\r\\n    with impatience. Suffer me then, lovely arbitress of my fate, to\\r\\n    approach you in person, to breathe in soft murmurs my passion to\\r\\n    your ear, to offer the sacrifice of a heart overflowing with the\\r\\n    most genuine and disinterested love, to gaze with ecstacy on the\\r\\n    divine object of my wishes, to hear the music of her enchanting\\r\\n    tongue, and to rejoice in her smiles of approbation, which will\\r\\n    banish the most intolerable suspense from the bosom of\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour enraptured, Râ\\x80\\x94 Râ\\x80\\x94.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving finished this effusion, I committed it to the care of my\\r\\nfaithful friend, with an injunction to second my entreaty with all her\\r\\neloquence and influence, and in the meantime went to dress, with an\\r\\nintention of visiting Mrs. Snapper and Miss, whom I had utterly\\r\\nneglected, and indeed almost forgotten, since my dear Narcissa had\\r\\nresumed the empire of my soul. The old gentlewoman received me very\\r\\nkindly, and Miss affected a frankness and gaiety which, however, I\\r\\ncould easily perceive was forced and dissembled: among other things,\\r\\nshe pretended to joke me upon my passion for Narcissa, which she\\r\\naverred was no secret, and asked if I intended to dance with her at the\\r\\nnext assembly. I was a good deal concerned to find myself become the\\r\\ntown talk on this subject, lest the squire, having notice of my\\r\\ninclinations, should disapprove of them, and, by breaking off all\\r\\ncorrespondence with me, deprive me of the opportunities I now enjoyed.\\r\\nBut I resolved to use the interest I had with him, while it lasted; and\\r\\nthat very night, meeting him occasionally, asked his permission to\\r\\nsolicit her company at the ball, which he very readily granted, to my\\r\\ninexpressible satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving been kept awake the greatest part of the night by a thousand\\r\\ndelightful reveries that took possession of my fancy, I got up by\\r\\ntimes, and, flying to the place of rendezvous, had in a little time the\\r\\npleasure of seeing Miss Williams approach with a smile on her\\r\\ncountenance, which I interpreted into a good omen. Neither was I\\r\\nmistaken in my presage. She presented me with a letter from the idol of\\r\\nmy soul, which, after having kissed it devoutly, I opened with the\\r\\nutmost eagerness, and was blessed with her approbation in these terms:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,\\r\\n    â\\x80\\x9cTo say I look upon you with indifference would be a piece of\\r\\n    dissimulation which I think no decorum requires, and no custom can\\r\\n    justify. As my heart never felt an impression that my tongue was\\r\\n    ashamed to declare, I will not scruple to own myself pleased with\\r\\n    your passion; confident of your integrity, and so well convinced of\\r\\n    my own discretion, that I should not hesitate in granting you the\\r\\n    interview you desire, were I not overawed by the prying curiosity\\r\\n    of a malicious world, the censure of which might be fatally\\r\\n    prejudicial to the reputation of\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour Narcissa.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo anchorite in the ecstacy of devotion ever adored a relic with more\\r\\nfervour than that with which I kissed this inimitable proof of my\\r\\ncharmerâ\\x80\\x99s candour, generosity, and affection! I read it over a hundred\\r\\ntimes, was ravished with her confession in the beginning; but the\\r\\nsubscription of Your Narcissa yielded me such delight as I had never\\r\\nfelt before! My happiness was still increased by Miss Williams, who\\r\\nblessed me with a repetition of her ladyâ\\x80\\x99s tender expressions in my\\r\\nfavour, when she received and read my letter. In short, I had all the\\r\\nreason in the world to believe that this gentle creatureâ\\x80\\x99s bosom was\\r\\npossessed by a passion for me, as warm, though perhaps not so impetuous\\r\\nas mine for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nI informed my friend of the squireâ\\x80\\x99s consent to my dancing with\\r\\nNarcissa at the ball and desired her to tell her mistress, that I would\\r\\ndo myself the honour of visiting her in the afternoon, in consequence\\r\\nof his permission, when I hoped to find her as indulgent as her brother\\r\\nhad been complaisant in that particular. Miss Williams expressed a good\\r\\ndeal of joy at hearing I was so much in favour with the foxhunter, and\\r\\nventured to assure me, that my visit would be very agreeable to my\\r\\nmistress, the rather because Bruin was engaged to dine abroad. This was\\r\\na circumstance which, I scarce need say, pleased me. I went immediately\\r\\nto the Long Room, where I found him, and, affecting to know nothing of\\r\\nhis engagement, told him, I would do myself the pleasure to wait upon\\r\\nhim in the afternoon, and to present his sister with a ticket for the\\r\\nball. He shook me by the hand, according to custom, and, giving me to\\r\\nunderstand that he was to dine abroad, desired me to go and drink tea\\r\\nwith Narcissa notwithstanding, and promised to prepare her for my visit\\r\\nin the meantime.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything succeeding thus to my wish, I waited with incredible\\r\\nimpatience for the time, which no sooner arrived than I hastened to the\\r\\nscene, which my fancy had preoccupied long before. I was introduced\\r\\naccordingly to the dear enchantress, whom I found accompanied by Miss\\r\\nWilliams, who, on pretence of ordering tea, retired at my approach.\\r\\nThis favourable accident, which alarmed my whole soul, disordered her\\r\\nalso. I found myself actuated by an irresistible impulse; I advanced to\\r\\nher with eagerness and awe; and, profiting by the confusion that\\r\\nprevailed over her, clasped the fair angel in my arms, and imprinted a\\r\\nglowing kiss upon her lips, more soft and fragrant than the dewy\\r\\nrosebud just bursting from the stem! Her face was in an instant covered\\r\\nwith blushes, her eyes sparkled with resentment; I threw myself at her\\r\\nfeet, and implored her pardon. Her love became advocate in my cause;\\r\\nher look softened into forgiveness; she raised me up, and chid me with\\r\\nso much sweetness of displeasure that I could have been tempted to\\r\\nrepeat the offence, had not the coming in of the servant with the\\r\\ntea-board prevented my presumption. While we were subject to be\\r\\ninterrupted or overheard, we conversed about the approaching ball, at\\r\\nwhich she promised to grace me as a partner, but, when the equipage was\\r\\nremoved, and we were left alone, I resumed the more interesting theme,\\r\\nand expressed myself with such transport and agitation, that my\\r\\nmistress, fearing I should commit some extravagance, rang the bell for\\r\\nher maid, whom she detained in the room, as a check upon my vivacity. I\\r\\nwas not sorry for this precaution, because I could unbosom myself\\r\\nwithout reserve before Miss Williams, who was the confidante of us\\r\\nboth. I therefore gave a loose to the inspirations of my passion, which\\r\\noperated so successfully upon the tender affections of Narcissa, that\\r\\nshe laid aside the constraint she had hitherto worn, and blessed me\\r\\nwith the most melting declaration of her mutual flame! It was\\r\\nimpossible for me to forbear taking the advantage of this endearing\\r\\ncondescension. She now gently yielded to my embraces; while I,\\r\\nencircling all that I held dear within my arms, tasted in advance the\\r\\njoys of that paradise I hoped in a little time wholly to possess! We\\r\\nspent the afternoon in all the ecstacy of hope that the most fervent\\r\\nlove exchanged by mutual vows could inspire; and Miss Williams was so\\r\\nmuch affected with our chaste caresses, which recalled the sad\\r\\nremembrance of what she was, that her eyes were filled with tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe evening being pretty far advanced, I forced myself from the dear\\r\\nobject of my flame, who indulged me in a tender embrace at parting,\\r\\nand, repairing to my lodgings, communicated to my friend Strap every\\r\\ncircumstance of my happiness, which filled him with so much pleasure,\\r\\nthat it ran over at his eyes; and he prayed heartily, that no envious\\r\\ndevil might, as formerly, dash the cup of blessing from my lip. When I\\r\\nreflected on what had happened, and especially on the unreserved\\r\\nprotestations of Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s love, I could not help being amazed at her\\r\\nomitting to inquire into the particular circumstances of life and\\r\\nfortune of one whom she had favoured with her affection, and I began to\\r\\nbe a little anxious about the situation of her finances; well knowing\\r\\nthat I should do an irreparable injury to the person my soul held most\\r\\ndear, if I should espouse her without being able to support her in the\\r\\nrank which was certainly her due. I had heard, indeed, while I served\\r\\nher aunt, that her father had left her a considerable sum; and that\\r\\neverybody believed she would inherit the greatest part of her\\r\\nkinswomanâ\\x80\\x99s dowry, but I did not know how far she might be restricted\\r\\nby the old gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s will in the enjoyment of what he left her: and I\\r\\nwas too well informed of the virtuosoâ\\x80\\x99s late conduct, to think my\\r\\nmistress could have any expectation from that quarter. I confided,\\r\\nhowever, in the good sense and policy of my charmer, who, I was sure,\\r\\nwould not consent to unite her fate with mine, before she had fully\\r\\nconsidered and provided for the consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ball night being arrived, I dressed myself in a suit I had reserved\\r\\nfor some grand occasion; and, having drunk tea with Narcissa and her\\r\\nbrother, conducted my angel to the scene, where she, in a moment,\\r\\neclipsed all her female competitors for beauty, and attracted the\\r\\nadmiration of the whole assembly. My heart dilated with pride on this\\r\\noccasion, and my triumph rejected all bounds, when, after we had danced\\r\\ntogether, a certain nobleman, remarkable for his figure, and influence\\r\\nin the beau monde, came up, and in the hearing of all present, honoured\\r\\nus with a very particular compliment upon our accomplishments and\\r\\nappearance; but this transport was soon checked, when I perceived his\\r\\nlordship attach himself with great assiduity to my mistress, and say\\r\\nsome warm things, which, I thought, savoured too much of passion. It\\r\\nwas then I began to feel the pangs of jealousy; I dreaded the power and\\r\\naddress of my rival; I sickened at his discourse; when she opened her\\r\\nlips to answer, my heart died within me; when she smiled, I felt the\\r\\npains of the damned! I was enraged at his presumption: I cursed her\\r\\ncomplaisance: at length he quitted her, and went to the other side of\\r\\nthe room. Narcissa, suspecting nothing of the rage that inflamed me,\\r\\nput some questions to me as soon as he was gone, to which I made no\\r\\nreply, but assumed a grim look, which too well denoted the agitation of\\r\\nmy breast, and surprised her not a little. She no sooner observed my\\r\\nemotion than she changed colour, and asked what ailed me? but before I\\r\\ncould make answer, her brother, pulling me by the sleeve, bade me take\\r\\nnotice of a lady who sat fronting us, whom I immediately, to my vast\\r\\nastonishment, distinguished to be Melinda, accompanied by her mother,\\r\\nand an elderly gentleman, whom I did not know. â\\x80\\x9cWounds! Mr. Randan,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncried the squire, â\\x80\\x9cis she not a delicate piece of stuff? â\\x80\\x99Sdeath! I\\r\\nhave a good mindâ\\x80\\x94if I thought she was a single person.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nNotwithstanding the perplexity I was in, I had reflection enough to\\r\\nforesee that my passion might suffer greatly by the presence of this\\r\\nlady, who, in all probability, would revenge herself upon me, for\\r\\nhaving formerly disgraced her, by spreading reports to my prejudice. I\\r\\nwas therefore alarmed at these symptoms of the Squireâ\\x80\\x99s admiration; and\\r\\nfor some time did not know what reply to make, when he asked my opinion\\r\\nof her beauty; at length I came to a determination, and told him that\\r\\nher name was Melinda, that she had a fortune of ten thousand pounds,\\r\\nand was said to be under promise of marriage to a certain lord, who\\r\\ndeferred his nuptials a few months, until he should be of age. I\\r\\nthought this piece of intelligence, which I had myself invented, would\\r\\nhave hindered him effectually from entertaining any further thoughts of\\r\\nher; but I was egregiously mistaken. The foxhunter had too much\\r\\nself-sufficiency to despair of success against any competitor on earth.\\r\\nHe therefore made light of her engagement, saying, with a smile of\\r\\nself-approbation, â\\x80\\x9cMayhap she will change her mind; what signifies his\\r\\nbeing a lord? I think myself as good a man as eâ\\x80\\x99er a lord in\\r\\nChristendom, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see if a commoner worth three thousand a year\\r\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t serve her turn.â\\x80\\x9d This determination startled me not a little; I\\r\\nknew he would soon discover the contrary of what I advanced; and as I\\r\\nbelieved he would find her ear open to his addresses, did not doubt of\\r\\nmeeting with every obstacle in my amour that her malice could invent,\\r\\nand her influence execute. This reflection increased my chagrinâ\\x80\\x94my\\r\\nvexation was evident. Narcissa insisted on going home immediately: and,\\r\\nas I led her to the door, her noble admirer, with a look full of\\r\\nlanguishment, directed to her a profound bow, which stung me to the\\r\\nsoul. Before she went into the chair, she asked, with an appearance of\\r\\nconcern, what was the matter with me? and I could pronounce no more\\r\\nthan â\\x80\\x9cBy heaven, I am distracted!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTortured with Jealousy, I go Home, and abuse Strapâ\\x80\\x94receive a Message\\r\\nfrom Narcissa, in Consequence of which I hasten to her Apartment, where\\r\\nher endearing Assurances banish all my Doubts and Apprehensionsâ\\x80\\x94in my\\r\\nRetreat discover Somebody in the Dark, whom, suspecting to be a Spy, I\\r\\nresolve to kill, but, to my great Surprise, am convinced of his being\\r\\nno other than Strapâ\\x80\\x94Melinda slanders meâ\\x80\\x94I become acquainted with Lord\\r\\nQuiverwit, who endeavours to sound me with regard to Narcissaâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nSquire is introduced to his Lordship, and grows cold towards meâ\\x80\\x94I learn\\r\\nfrom my Confidante, that this Nobleman professes honourable Love to my\\r\\nMistress, who continues faithful to me, notwithstanding the scandalous\\r\\nReports she had heard to my Prejudiceâ\\x80\\x94I am mortified with an Assurance\\r\\nthat her whole Fortune depends upon the Pleasure of her Brotherâ\\x80\\x94Mr.\\r\\nFreeman condoles me on the Decline of my Character, which I vindicate\\r\\nso much to his satisfaction, that he undertakes to combat Fame on my\\r\\nbehalf\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving uttered this exclamation, at which she sighed, I went home in\\r\\nthe condition of a frantic Bedlamite: and, finding the fire in my\\r\\napartment almost extinguished, vented my fury upon poor Strap, whose\\r\\near I pinched with such violence, that he roared hideously with pain;\\r\\nand, when I quitted my hold, looked so foolishly aghast, that no\\r\\nunconcerned spectator could have seen him without being seized with an\\r\\nimmoderate fit of laughter. It is true, I was soon sensible of the\\r\\ninjury I had done, and asked pardon for the outrage I had committed;\\r\\nupon which my faithful valet, shaking his head, said, â\\x80\\x9cI forgive you,\\r\\nand may God forgive you!â\\x80\\x9d But he could not help shedding some tears at\\r\\nmy unkindness. I felt unspeakable remorse for what I had done, cursed\\r\\nmy own ingratitude, and considered his tears as a reproach that my\\r\\nsoul, in its present disturbance, could not bear. It set all my\\r\\npassions into a ferment: I swore horrible oaths without meaning or\\r\\napplication. I foamed at the mouth, kicked the chairs about the room,\\r\\nand played abundance of mad pranks that frightened my friend almost out\\r\\nof his senses. At length my transport subsided, I became melancholy,\\r\\nand wept insensibly.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this state of dejection, I was surprised with the appearance of\\r\\nMiss Williams, whom Strap, blubbering all the while, had conducted into\\r\\nthe chamber without giving me previous notice of her approach. She was\\r\\nextremely affected with my condition, which she had learned from him,\\r\\nbegged me to moderate my passion, suspend my conjectures, and follow\\r\\nher to Narcissa, who desired to see me forthwith. That dear name\\r\\noperated upon me like a charm! I started up, and, without opening my\\r\\nlips, was conducted into her apartment through the garden, which we\\r\\nentered by a private door. I found the adorable creature in tears; I\\r\\nwas melted at the sightâ\\x80\\x94we continued silent for some timeâ\\x80\\x94my heart was\\r\\ntoo full to speakâ\\x80\\x94her snowy bosom heaved with fond resentment; at last\\r\\nshe sobbing cried, â\\x80\\x9cWhat have I done to disoblige you?â\\x80\\x9d My heart was\\r\\npierced with the tender question. I drew near with the utmost reverence\\r\\nof affection. I fell upon my knees before her, and, kissing her hand,\\r\\nexclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cOh! thou art all goodness and perfection! I am undone by\\r\\nwant of merit; I am unworthy to possess thy charms, which heaven hath\\r\\ndestined for the arms of some more favourite being.â\\x80\\x9d She guessed the\\r\\ncause of my disquiet, upbraided me gently for my suspicion, and gave me\\r\\nsuch flattering assurances of her eternal fidelity, that all my doubts\\r\\nand fears forsook me, and peace and satisfaction reigned within my\\r\\nbreast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt midnight I left the fair nymph to her repose, and, being let out by\\r\\nMiss Williams at the garden gate by which I entered, began to explore\\r\\nmy way homeward in the dark, when I heard at my back a noise like that\\r\\nof a baboon when he mews and chatters. I turned instantly, and,\\r\\nperceiving something black, concluded I was discovered by some spy,\\r\\nemployed to watch for that purpose; aroused at this conjecture, by\\r\\nwhich the reputation of the virtuous Narcissa appeared in jeopardy, I\\r\\ndrew my sword, and would have sacrificed him to her fame, had not the\\r\\nvoice of Strap restrained my arm, it was with great difficulty he could\\r\\npronounce, â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94dâ\\x80\\x94d-do! mumâ\\x80\\x94umâ\\x80\\x94umâ\\x80\\x94murder me if you please.â\\x80\\x9d Such an\\r\\neffect had the cold upon his jaws, that his teeth rattled like a pair\\r\\nof castanets. Pleased to be thus undeceived, I laughed at his\\r\\nconsternation, and asked what brought him thither? Upon which he gave\\r\\nme to understand, that his concern for me had induced him to follow me\\r\\nto that place, where the same reason had detained him till now, and he\\r\\nfrankly owned, that, in spite of the esteem he had for Miss Williams he\\r\\nbegan to be very uneasy about me, considering the disposition in which\\r\\nI went abroad; and, if I had stayed much longer, would certainly have\\r\\nalarmed the neighbourhood in my behalf. The knowledge of this his\\r\\nintention confounded me. I represented to him the mischievous\\r\\nconsequences that would have attended such a rash action, and,\\r\\ncautioning him severely against any such design for the future,\\r\\nconcluded my admonition with an assurance, that, in case he should ever\\r\\nact so madly, I would, without hesitation, put him to death. â\\x80\\x9cHave a\\r\\nlittle patience!â\\x80\\x9d cried he, in a lamentable tone; â\\x80\\x9cyour displeasure\\r\\nwill do the business, without your committing murder.â\\x80\\x9d I was touched\\r\\nwith this reproach; and, as soon as we got home, made it my business to\\r\\nappease him, by explaining the cause of that transport during which I\\r\\nhad used him so unworthily.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day when I went into the Long Room, I observed several whispers\\r\\ncirculate all of a sudden, and did not doubt that Melinda had been busy\\r\\nwith my character; but I consoled myself with the love of Narcissa,\\r\\nupon which I rested with the most perfect confidence; and going up to\\r\\nthe rowly-powly table, won a few pieces from my suspected rival, who,\\r\\nwith an easy politeness, entered into conversation with me, and,\\r\\ndesiring my company to the coffee-house, treated me with tea and\\r\\nchocolate. I remembered Strutwell, and guarded against his insinuating\\r\\nbehaviour; nor was my suspicion wrong placed; he artfully turned the\\r\\ndiscourse upon Narcissa, and endeavoured by hinting at an intrigue he\\r\\npretended to be engaged in elsewhere, to learn what connection there\\r\\nwas between her and me. But all his finesse was ineffectual, I was\\r\\nconvinced of his dissimulation, and gave such general answers to his\\r\\ninquiries, that he was forced to drop the subject, and talk of\\r\\nsomething else.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we conversed in this manner, the savage came in with another\\r\\ngentleman, who introduced him to his lordship, and he was received with\\r\\nsuch peculiar marks of distinction, that I was persuaded the courtier\\r\\nintended to use him in some shape or other; and from thence I drew an\\r\\nunlucky omen. But I had more cause to be dismayed the following day,\\r\\nwhen I saw the squire in company with Melinda and her mother, who\\r\\nhonoured me with several disdainful glances; and when I afterwards\\r\\nthrew myself in his way, instead of the cordial shake of the hand, he\\r\\nreturned my salute with a cold repetition of â\\x80\\x9cServant, servant!â\\x80\\x9d which\\r\\nhe pronounced with such indifference or rather contempt, that if he had\\r\\nnot been Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s brother, I should have affronted him in public.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese occurrences disturbed me not a little; I foresaw the brooding\\r\\nstorm, and armed myself with resolution for the occasion; but Narcissa,\\r\\nbeing at stake, I was far from being resigned. I could have renounced\\r\\nevery other comfort of life with some degree of fortitude, but the\\r\\nprospect of losing her disabled all my philosophy, and tortured my soul\\r\\ninto madness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Williams found me, next morning, full of anxious tumult, which did\\r\\nnot abate when she told me that my Lord Quiverwit, having professed\\r\\nhonourable intentions, had been introduced to my lovely mistress by her\\r\\nbrother, who had, at the same time, from the information of Melinda,\\r\\nspoken of me as an Irish fortune-hunter, without either birth or\\r\\nestate; who supported myself in the appearance of a gentleman by\\r\\nsharping and other infamous practices; and who was of such an obscure\\r\\norigin, that I did not even know my own extraction. Though I expected\\r\\nall this malice, I could not hear it with temper, especially as truth\\r\\nwas so blended with falsehood in the assertion, that it would be almost\\r\\nimpossible to separate the one from the other in my vindication. But I\\r\\nsaid nothing on this head, being impatient to know how Narcissa had\\r\\nbeen affected with the discovery. That generous creature, far from\\r\\nbelieving these imprecations, was no sooner withdrawn with her\\r\\nconfidante, than she inveighed with great warmth against the\\r\\nmalevolence of the world, to which only she ascribed the whole of what\\r\\nhad been said to my disadvantage, and, calling every circumstance of my\\r\\nbehaviour to her into review before her, found everything so polite,\\r\\nhonourable, and disinterested, that she could not harbour the least\\r\\ndoubt of my being the gentleman I assumed. â\\x80\\x9cI have indeed,â\\x80\\x9d said she,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpurposely forborne to ask the particulars of his life, lest the\\r\\nrecapitulation of some misfortunes, which he has undergone, should give\\r\\nhim pain; and, as to the article of his fortune, I own myself equally\\r\\nafraid of inquiring into it, and of discovering the state of my own,\\r\\nlest we should find ourselves both unhappy in the explanation; for,\\r\\nalas! my provision is conditional, and depends entirely on my marrying\\r\\nwith my brotherâ\\x80\\x99s consent.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was thunderstruck with this intelligence, the light forsook my eyes,\\r\\nthe colour vanished from my cheeks, and I remained in a state of\\r\\nuniversal trepidation! My female friend, perceiving my disorder,\\r\\nencouraged me with assurances of Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s constancy, and the hope of\\r\\nsome accident favourable to our love; and, as a further consolation,\\r\\ngave me to understand, that she had acquainted my mistress with the\\r\\noutlines of my life: and that, although she was no stranger to the\\r\\npresent low state of my finances, her love and esteem were rather\\r\\nincreased than diminished by the knowledge of my circumstances. I was\\r\\ngreatly comforted by this assurance, which saved me a world of\\r\\nconfusion and anxiety; for I must have imparted my situation one day to\\r\\nNarcissa, and this task I could not have performed without shame and\\r\\ndisorder.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I did not doubt that by this time the scandalous aspersions of\\r\\nMelinda were diffused all over the town, I resolved to collect my whole\\r\\nstrength of assurance, to browbeat the efforts of her malice, and to\\r\\npublish her adventure with the frenchified barber by way of reprisal.\\r\\nIn the meantime, having promised to be at the garden-gate about\\r\\nmidnight, Miss Williams took her leave, bidding me repose myself\\r\\nentirely on the affection of my dear Narcissa, which was as perfect as\\r\\ninviolable. Before I went abroad, I was visited by Freeman, who came on\\r\\npurpose to inform me of the infamous stories that were raised at my\\r\\nexpense. I heard them with great temper, and in my turn disclosed\\r\\neverything that had happened between Melinda and me; and among other\\r\\ncircumstances entertained him with the story of the barber, letting him\\r\\nknow what share his friend Banter had in that affair. He was convinced\\r\\nof the injury my reputation had suffered; and, no longer doubting the\\r\\nfountain from whence this deluge of slander had flowed upon me,\\r\\nundertook to undeceive the town in my behalf, and roll the stream back\\r\\nupon its source; but in the meantime, cautioned me from appearing in\\r\\npublic, while the prepossession was so strong against me, lest I should\\r\\nmeet with some affront that might have bad consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LIX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI receive an extraordinary Message at the Door of the Long Room, which,\\r\\nhowever, enter, and affront the Squire, who threatens to take the Law\\r\\nof meâ\\x80\\x94Rebuke Melinda for her Maliceâ\\x80\\x94she weeps with Vexationâ\\x80\\x94Lord\\r\\nQuiverwit is severe upon meâ\\x80\\x94I retort his Sarcasmâ\\x80\\x94am received with the\\r\\nutmost Tenderness by Narcissa, who desires to hear the Story of my\\r\\nLifeâ\\x80\\x94we vow eternal Constancy to otherâ\\x80\\x94I retireâ\\x80\\x94am waked by a\\r\\nMessenger, who brings a Challenge from Quiverwit, whom I meet, engage,\\r\\nand vanquish\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI thanked him for his advice, which, however, my pride and resentment\\r\\nwould not permit me to follow; for he no sooner left me, in order to do\\r\\njustice to my character among his friends and acquaintance, than I\\r\\nsallied out, and went directly to the Long Room. I was met at the door\\r\\nby a servant, who presented a billet to me without a subscription,\\r\\nimporting that my presence was disagreeable to the company, and\\r\\ndesiring I would take the hint without further disturbance, and bestow\\r\\nmyself elsewhere for the future. This peremptory message filled me with\\r\\nindignation. I followed the fellow who delivered it, and, seizing him\\r\\nby the collar in presence of all the company, threatened to put him\\r\\ninstantly to death, if he did not discover the scoundrel who had\\r\\ncharged him with such an impudent commission, that I might punish him\\r\\nas he deserved. The messenger, affrighted at my menaces and furious\\r\\nlooks, fell upon his knees, and told me, that the gentleman who ordered\\r\\nhim to deliver the letter was no other than Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s brother, who, at\\r\\nthat time, stood at the other end of the room, talking to Melinda. I\\r\\nwent up to him immediately, and in the hearing of his inamorata,\\r\\naccosted him in these words; â\\x80\\x9cLookee, squire, were it not for one\\r\\nconsideration that protects you from my resentment, I would cane you\\r\\nwhere you stand, for having had the presumption to send me this\\r\\nscurrilous intimation;â\\x80\\x9d which I tore to pieces and threw in his face:\\r\\nat the same time darting an angry regard at his mistress, I told her, I\\r\\nwas sorry she had put it out of my power to compliment her upon her\\r\\ninvention, but at the expense of her good nature and veracity. Her\\r\\nadmirer, whose courage never rose, but in proportion to the wine he had\\r\\nswallowed, instead of resenting my address in what is called an\\r\\nhonourable way, threatened to prosecute me for an assault, and took\\r\\nwitnesses accordingly: while she, piqued at his pusillanimous\\r\\nbehaviour, and enraged at the sarcasm I had uttered against her,\\r\\nendeavoured to make her quarrel a public cause, and wept aloud with\\r\\nspite and vexation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tears of a lady could not fail of attracting the notice and concern\\r\\nof the spectators to whom she complained of my rudeness with great\\r\\nbitterness, saying, if she were a man, I durst not use her so. The\\r\\ngreatest part of the gentlemen, already prejudiced against me, were\\r\\noffended at the liberty I had taken, as appeared from their looks;\\r\\nthough none of them signified their disgust any other way except my\\r\\nLord Quiverwit, who ventured to say, with a sneer, that I was in the\\r\\nright to establish my own character, of which he had now no longer any\\r\\ndoubt. Nettled at this severe equivocation, which raised a laugh at my\\r\\nexpense, I replied with some warmth, â\\x80\\x9cI am proud of having in that\\r\\nparticular got the start of your lordship.â\\x80\\x9d He made no answer to my\\r\\nrepartee, but with a contemptuous smile walked off, leaving me in a\\r\\nvery disagreeable situation. In vain did I make up to several people of\\r\\nmy acquaintance, whose conversation, I hoped, would banish my\\r\\nconfusion; everybody shunned me like a person infected, and I should\\r\\nnot have been able to bear my disgrace, had not the idea of the ever\\r\\nfaithful and fond Narcissa come to my relief. I quitted the scene of my\\r\\nmortification, and, sauntering about the town, happened to wake from my\\r\\ncontemplation, when I found myself just opposite to a toy-shop, which I\\r\\nentered, and purchased a ring set with a ruby in the form of a heart,\\r\\nsurrounded by diamond sparks, for which I paid ten guineas, intending\\r\\nit for a present to the charmer of my soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was introduced, at the hour appointed, to this divine creature, who,\\r\\nnotwithstanding what she had heard to my disadvantage, received me with\\r\\nthe utmost confidence and tenderness; and, having been informed of the\\r\\ngeneral sketches of my life by Miss Williams, expressed a desire, of\\r\\nknowing the particular circumstances, which I related with great\\r\\ncandour, omitting, however, some things which I concluded altogether\\r\\nimproper for her ear, and which the readerâ\\x80\\x99s reflection will easily\\r\\nsuggest. As my story was little else than a recital of misfortunes, the\\r\\ntear of sympathy ceased not to trickle from her enchanting eyes during\\r\\nthe whole of the narration, which, when I had finished, she recompensed\\r\\nme for my trouble with the most endearing protestations of eternal\\r\\nlove. She bewailed her restricted condition, as it was the means of\\r\\nretarding my happiness; told me that Lord Quiverwit, by her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npermission, had been to drink tea with her that very afternoon, and\\r\\nactually proposed marriage; and, seeing me extremely affected with this\\r\\npiece of information, offered to give me a convincing proof of her\\r\\naffection, by espousing me in private, and leaving the rest to fate. I\\r\\nwas penetrated with this instance of her regard, but, that I might not\\r\\nbe outdone in generosity, resisted the bewitching temptation in\\r\\nconsideration of her honour and interest; at the same time I presented\\r\\nmy ring as a pledge of my inviolable attachment, and, on my knees,\\r\\nimplored Heaven to shower its curses on my head, if ever my heart\\r\\nshould entertain one thought unworthy of the passion I then avowed. She\\r\\nreceived my token, gave me in return her picture in miniature,\\r\\nexquisitely drawn and set in gold; and, in the same posture, called\\r\\nHeaven to witness and to judge her flame. Our vows being thus\\r\\nreciprocally breathed, a confidence of hope ensued, and our mutual\\r\\nfondness becoming as intimate as innocence would allow, I grew\\r\\ninsensible of the progress of time, and it was morning before I could\\r\\ntear myself from this darling of my soul! My good angel foresaw what\\r\\nwould happen, and permitted me to indulge myself on this occasion, in\\r\\nconsideration of the fatal absence I was doomed to suffer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to bed immediately on my return to my lodging, and, having slept\\r\\nabout two hours, was waked by Strap, who in great confusion told me\\r\\nthere was a footman below with a letter, which he would deliver to\\r\\nnobody but myself. Alarmed at this piece of news, I desired my friend\\r\\nto show him into my chamber, and received the following letter, which,\\r\\nhe said, required an immediate answer:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x94\\r\\n    â\\x80\\x9cWhen any man injures my honour, let the difference of rank between\\r\\n    us be ever so great, I am contented to wave the privilege of my\\r\\n    quality, and to seek reparation from him on equal terms. The\\r\\n    insolence of your reply to me yesterday, in the Long Room, I might\\r\\n    have overlooked, had not your presumptive emulation in a much more\\r\\n    interesting affair, and which I made this morning, concurred in\\r\\n    persuading me to chastise your audacity with my sword. If you\\r\\n    therefore have spirit enough to support the character you assume,\\r\\n    you will not fail to follow the bearer immediately to a convenient\\r\\n    place, where you shall be met by\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cQuiverwit.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether I was enervated by the love and favour of Narcissa, or awed by\\r\\nthe superior station of my antagonist, I know not, but I never had less\\r\\ninclination to fight than at this time. However, finding there was a\\r\\nnecessity for vindicating the reputation of my mistress, as well as for\\r\\nasserting my own honour, I forthwith rose, and, dressing in a hurry,\\r\\nput on my sword, bade Strap attend me, and set out with my conductor,\\r\\ncursing my bad fortune all the way, for having been observed in my\\r\\nreturn from my angel; for so I interpreted his lordshipâ\\x80\\x99s discovery.\\r\\nWhen I came within sight of my rival, his lacquey told me he had orders\\r\\nto stop; upon which I commanded Strap to halt also, while I walked\\r\\nforward; resolving, if possible, to come to an explanation with my\\r\\nchallenger, before we should come to battle. Nor was an opportunity\\r\\nwanting; for I no sooner approached than he asked, with a stern\\r\\ncountenance, what business I had in Mr. Topehallâ\\x80\\x99s garden so early in\\r\\nthe morning? â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know, my lord,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9chow to answer a question\\r\\nput to me with such magisterial haughtiness. If your lordship will\\r\\nplease to expostulate calmly, you will have no cause to repent of your\\r\\ncondescension; otherwise I am not to be intimated into any confession.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is no room for denial,â\\x80\\x9d answered he; â\\x80\\x9cI saw you come out with my\\r\\nown eyes.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cDid any other see me?â\\x80\\x9d said I. â\\x80\\x9cI neither know nor care,â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid he; â\\x80\\x9cI want no other evidence than that of my own senses.â\\x80\\x9d Pleased\\r\\nto hear that the suspicion was confined to him alone, I endeavoured to\\r\\nappease his jealousy, by owning an intrigue with the waiting maid: but\\r\\nhe had too much discernment to be so easily imposed upon, and told me\\r\\nthere was only one way to convince him of the truth of what I alleged,\\r\\nwhich was no other than renouncing all claim to Narcissa upon oath, and\\r\\npromising, upon honour, never to speak to her for the future.\\r\\nExasperated at this proposal, I unsheathed my sword, saying, â\\x80\\x9cHeavens!\\r\\nwhat title have you, or any man on earth, to impose such terms on me?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nHe did the same, and making towards me with a contracted brow, said I\\r\\nwas a villain, and had dishonoured Narcissa. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s a villain,â\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\nreplied, in a transport of fury, â\\x80\\x9cwho brands me with that imputation!\\r\\nShe is a thousand times more chaste than the mother that bore you; and\\r\\nI will assert her honour with my heartâ\\x80\\x99s blood!â\\x80\\x9d So saying, I rushed\\r\\nupon him with more eagerness than address, and, endeavouring to get\\r\\nwithin his point, received a wound in my neck, which redoubled my rage.\\r\\nHe excelled me in temper as well as in skill, by which means he parried\\r\\nmy thrusts with great calmness, until I had almost exhausted my\\r\\nspirits; and, when he perceived me beginning to flag, attacked me\\r\\nfiercely in his turn. Finding himself, however, better opposed than he\\r\\nexpected, he resolved to follow his lounge, and close with me;\\r\\naccordingly, his sword entered my waistcoat, on the side of the breast\\r\\nbone, and, running up between my shirt and skin, appeared over my left\\r\\nshoulder. I imagined that his weapon had perforated my lungs, and of\\r\\nconsequence that the wound was mortal; therefore, determined not to die\\r\\nunrevenged, I seized his shell, which was close to my breast, before he\\r\\ncould disentangle his point, and, keeping it fast with my left hand,\\r\\nshortened my own sword with my right, intending to run him through the\\r\\nheart; but he received the thrust in the left arm, which penetrated up\\r\\nto the shoulder blade. Disappointed at this expectation, and afraid\\r\\nstill that death would frustrate my revenge, I grappled with him, and,\\r\\nbeing much the stronger, threw him upon the ground, where I wrested his\\r\\nsword out of his hand, and, so great was my confusion, that instead of\\r\\nturning the point upon him, struck out three of his foreteeth with the\\r\\nhilt. In the meantime, our servants, seeing us fall, ran up to separate\\r\\nand assist us; but before their approach I was upon my feet, and had\\r\\ndiscovered that my supposed mortal wound was only a slight scratch. The\\r\\nknowledge of my own safety disarmed me of a good deal of my resentment,\\r\\nand I began to inquire with some concern into the situation of my\\r\\nantagonist, who remained on the ground bleeding plentifully at his\\r\\nmouth and arm. I helped his footman to raise him, and, having bound up\\r\\nhis wound with my handkerchief, assured it was not dangerous; I\\r\\nlikewise restored his sword, and offered to support him to his house.\\r\\nHe thanked me with an air of sullen dignity: and whispering that I\\r\\nshould hear from him soon, went away, leaning on his servantâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was surprised at this promise, which I construed into a threat, and\\r\\nresolved, if ever he should call me out again, to use whatever\\r\\nadvantage fortune might give me over him in another manner. In the\\r\\nmeantime I had leisure to take notice of Strap, who seemed quite\\r\\nstupified with horror: I comforted him with an assurance, that I had\\r\\nreceived no damage, and explained the nature of this affair as we\\r\\nwalked homeward. By the time I had got into my apartment, I found the\\r\\nwound in my neck stiff and uneasy, and a good deal of clotted blood ran\\r\\ndown upon my shirt; upon which I pulled off my coat and waistcoat, and\\r\\nunbuttoned my collar, that I might dress it with more ease. My friend\\r\\nno sooner perceived my shirt quite dyed with blood, than, imagining I\\r\\nhad got at least twenty thousand wounds, he cried, â\\x80\\x9cO Jesus!â\\x80\\x9d and fell\\r\\nflat on the floor. I stopped the bleeding with a little dry lint, and,\\r\\napplying a plaster over it, cleaned myself from the gore, shifted, and\\r\\ndressed, while he lay senseless at my feet, so that when he recovered,\\r\\nand saw me perfectly well, he could scarce believe his own eyes. Now\\r\\nthat the danger was passed, I was very well pleased with what had\\r\\nhappened, hoping that it would soon become known, and consequently\\r\\ndignify my character not a little in this place. I was also proud of\\r\\nhaving shown myself, in some shape, worthy of the love of Narcissa,\\r\\nwho, I was persuaded, would not think the worse of me for what I had\\r\\ndone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI am visited by Freeman, with whom I appear in Public, and am\\r\\ncaressedâ\\x80\\x94am sent for by Lord Quiverwit, whose Presence I quit\\r\\nflungâ\\x80\\x94Narcissa is carried off by her Brotherâ\\x80\\x94I intend to pursue him,\\r\\nand am dissuaded by my Friendâ\\x80\\x94engage in Play, and lose all my Moneyâ\\x80\\x94set\\r\\nout for Londonâ\\x80\\x94try my Fortune at the Gaming Table without\\r\\nsuccessâ\\x80\\x94receive a letter from Narcissaâ\\x80\\x94bilk my Tailor\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I entertained myself with these reflections, the news of the\\r\\nduel, being communicated by some unknown channel, spread all over the\\r\\ntown. I was visited by Freeman, who testified his surprise at finding\\r\\nme; for it was told, that Lord Quiverwit being dead of his wounds, I\\r\\nhad absconded, in order to avoid the cognizance of the law. I asked, if\\r\\npeople guessed the occasion of the quarrel; and, understanding it was\\r\\nattributed to his lordshipâ\\x80\\x99s resentment of my reply in the Long Room,\\r\\nconfirmed that conjecture, glad to find Narcissa unsuspected. My\\r\\nfriend, after I had assured him that my antagonist was in no danger,\\r\\nwished me joy of the event, than which, he said, nothing could happen\\r\\nmore opportunely to support the idea he had given of my character to\\r\\nhis friends, among whom he had been very assiduous in my behalf.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the strength of this assurance, I went with him to the coffee-house,\\r\\nwhere I was saluted by a great many of those very persons who had\\r\\nshunned me the preceding day; and I found everybody making merry with\\r\\nthe story of Melindaâ\\x80\\x99s French gallant. While I remained in this place,\\r\\nI received a message from Lord Quiverwit, desiring, if I were not\\r\\nengaged, to see me at his house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThither I immediately repaired, and was conducted to an apartment where\\r\\nI was received by his lordship in bed. When we were left by ourselves,\\r\\nhe thanked me in very polite terms for having used the advantage\\r\\nfortune had given me over him with such moderation, and asked pardon\\r\\nfor any offence his resentment might have prompted him to commit. â\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nwould willingly,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cmake you my friend; but, as it is\\r\\nimpossible for me to divest myself of my passion for Narcissa, I am too\\r\\nwell convinced of your sentiments, to think we shall ever agree on that\\r\\nsubject. I took the liberty, therefore, of sending for you, in order to\\r\\nown candidly, that I cannot help opposing your success with that young\\r\\nlady; though, at the same time I promise to regulate my opposition by\\r\\nthe dictates of justice and honour. This, however, I think proper to\\r\\nadvertise you of, that she has no independent fortune; and, if you\\r\\nshould even succeed in your addresses, you will have the mortification\\r\\nto see her reduced to indigence, unless you have wherewithal to support\\r\\nherâ\\x80\\x94and I am credibly informed of your incapacity that wayâ\\x80\\x94nay, I will\\r\\nconfess, that, urged by this consideration, I have actually sent notice\\r\\nto her brother of the progress I suspect you have made in her\\r\\naffection, and desired him to take his precautions accordingly.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nAlarmed and provoked at this information, I told his lordship, that I\\r\\ndid not see how he could reconcile that piece of conduct with his\\r\\nprofession of open dealing, and flung away from him in a passion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I walked homeward, in hope of hearing from my mistress as usual by\\r\\nmeans of Miss Williams, I was surprised with the waving of a\\r\\nhandkerchief from the window of a coach-and-six that passed by me at\\r\\nfull speed: and upon further observation, I saw a servant on horseback\\r\\nriding after it, who, I knew by his livery, belonged to the squire.\\r\\nThunderstruck with this discovery, the knowledge of my misfortune\\r\\nrushed all at once upon my reflection! I guessed immediately that the\\r\\nsignal was made by the dear hand of Narcissa, who, being hurried away\\r\\nin consequence of Lord Quiverwitâ\\x80\\x99s message to her brother, had no other\\r\\nmethod of relating her distress, and imploring my assistance. Frantic\\r\\nwith this conjecture, I ran to my lodgings, snatched my pistols, and\\r\\nordered Strap to get post-horses, with such incoherence of speech and\\r\\ndisorder, that the poor valet, terrified with the suspicion of another\\r\\nduel, instead of providing what I desired, went forthwith to Freeman,\\r\\nwho, being informed of my behaviour, came straight to my apartment, and\\r\\nconjured me so pathetically to make him acquainted with the cause of my\\r\\nuneasiness, that I could not refuse telling him my happiness was fled\\r\\nwith Narcissa, and that I must retrieve her or perish. He represented\\r\\nthe madness of such an undertaking, and endeavoured to divert me from\\r\\nit with great strength of friendship and reason. But all his arguments\\r\\nwould have been ineffectual, had he not put me in mind of the\\r\\ndependence I ought to have on the love of Narcissa, and the attachment\\r\\nof her maid, who could not fail of finding opportunities to advertise\\r\\nme of their situation; and at the same time demonstrated the injury my\\r\\ncharmerâ\\x80\\x99s reputation must suffer from my precipitate retreat. I was\\r\\nconvinced and composed by these considerations: I appeared in public\\r\\nwith an air of tranquillity, was well received by the best company in\\r\\ntown, and, my misfortune taking air, condoled accordingly: while I had\\r\\nthe satisfaction of seeing Melinda so universally discountenanced that\\r\\nshe was fain to return to London, in order to avoid the scoffs and\\r\\ncensure of the ladies at Bath. But, though the hope of hearing from the\\r\\ndarling of my soul supported my spirits a little while, I began to be\\r\\nvery uneasy, when, at the end of several weeks I found that expectation\\r\\ndisappointed. In short, melancholy and despondence took possession of\\r\\nmy soul; and, repining at that providence which, by acting the\\r\\nstepmother towards me, kept me from the fruition of my wishes, I\\r\\ndetermined, in a fit of despair, to risk all I had at the gaming table,\\r\\nwith a view of acquiring a fortune sufficient to render me independent\\r\\nfor life; or of plunging myself into such a state of misery, as would\\r\\neffectually crush every ambitious hope that now tortured my\\r\\nimagination.\\r\\n\\r\\nActuated by this fatal resolution, I engaged in play, and, after some\\r\\nturns of fortune found myself, at the end of three days, worth a\\r\\nthousand pounds; but it was not my intention to stop there, for which\\r\\ncause I kept Strap ignorant of my success, and continued my career\\r\\nuntil I was reduced to five guineas, which I would have hazarded also,\\r\\nhad I not been ashamed to fall from a bet of two hundred pounds to such\\r\\na petty sum.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving thus executed my scheme, I went home, amazed to find myself so\\r\\nmuch at ease, and informed my friend Strap of my mischance with such\\r\\ncalmness, that he, imagining I joked, affected to receive the tidings\\r\\nwith great equanimity. But both he and I found ourselves mistaken very\\r\\nsoon. I had misinterpreted my own stupidity into deliberate\\r\\nresignation, and he had reason to believe me in earnest when he saw me\\r\\nnext morning agitated with the most violent despair, which he\\r\\nendeavoured to alleviate with all the consolation in his power.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one of my lucid intervals, however, I charged him to take a place in\\r\\nthe stage coach for London; and, in the meantime, paid my debts in\\r\\nBath, which amounted to thirty shillings only. Without taking leave of\\r\\nmy friends, I embarked, Strap having the good fortune to find a return\\r\\nhorse, and arrived in town, without having met with anything remarkable\\r\\non the road. While we crossed Bagshot Heath, I was seized with a sort\\r\\nof inclination to retrieve my fortune, by laying passengers under\\r\\ncontribution in some such place. My thoughts were so circumstanced at\\r\\nthis time, that I should have digested the crime of robbery, so\\r\\nrighteously had I concerted my plan, and ventured my life in the\\r\\nexecution, had I not been deterred by reflecting upon the infamy that\\r\\nattends detection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment I formerly lived in being unengaged, I took possession of\\r\\nit, and next day went in quest of Banter, who received me with open\\r\\narms, in expectation of having his bond discharged to his liking: but\\r\\nwhen he understood what had happened, his countenance changed of a\\r\\nsudden, and he told me, with a dryness of displeasure peculiar to\\r\\nhimself, that, if he were in my place, he would put it out of fortuneâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npower to play him such another trick, and be avenged of his own\\r\\nindiscretion at once. When I desired him to explain his meaning, he\\r\\npointed to his neck, raised himself on his tiptoes, and was going away\\r\\nwithout any further ceremony, when I put him in mind of my indigence,\\r\\nand demanded the five guineas I had formerly lent him. â\\x80\\x9cFive guineas?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncried he; â\\x80\\x9czounds! had you acted with common prudence, you might have\\r\\nhad twenty thousand in your pocket by this time. I depended upon five\\r\\nhundred from you, as much as if I had had notes for it in the bank; and\\r\\nby all the rules of equity, you are indebted to me for that sum.â\\x80\\x9d I was\\r\\nneither pleased nor convinced by this computation, and insisted on my\\r\\nright with such determined obstinacy, that he was fain to alter his\\r\\nton, and appease my clamour by assuring me, that he was not master of\\r\\nfive shillings. Society in distress generally promotes good\\r\\nunderstanding among people; from being a dun I descended to be a\\r\\nclient, and asked his advice about repairing my losses. He counselled\\r\\nme to have recourse again to the gaming table, where I succeeded so\\r\\nwell before, and put myself in a condition by selling my watch. I\\r\\nfollowed his directions, and, having accommodated him with a few\\r\\npieces, went to the place, where I lost every shilling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I returned to my lodgings full of desperate resolution, and having\\r\\nmade Strap acquainted with my fate, ordered him to pawn my sword\\r\\nimmediately, that I might be enabled to make another effort. This\\r\\naffectionate creature no sooner understood my purpose, than, seized\\r\\nwith insupportable sorrow at the prospect of my misery, he burst into\\r\\ntears, and asked what I proposed to do after the small sum he could\\r\\nraise on the sword should be spent. â\\x80\\x9cOn my own accountâ\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cI am\\r\\nquite unconcerned; for, while God spares me health and these ten\\r\\nfingers, I can earn a comfortable subsistence anywhere; but what must\\r\\nbecome of you, who have less humility to stoop, and more appetites to\\r\\ngratify?â\\x80\\x9d Here I interrupted him, by saying, with a gloomy aspect, I\\r\\nshould never want a resource while I had a loaded pistol in possession.\\r\\nStupified with horror at this dreadful insinuation, he stood mute for\\r\\nsome time and then broke out into â\\x80\\x9cGod of his infinite mercy enable you\\r\\nto withstand that temptation of the devil! Consider your immortal\\r\\nsoulâ\\x80\\x94thereâ\\x80\\x99s no repentance in the grave! O Lord! that we ever should\\r\\nhave come to this! Are we not enjoined to resign ourselves to the will\\r\\nof Heaven?â\\x80\\x94where is your patience?â\\x80\\x94Durum patientia frangoâ\\x80\\x94you are but a\\r\\nyoung manâ\\x80\\x94there may be many good things in store for youâ\\x80\\x94accidit in\\r\\npuncto quo non speratur in annoâ\\x80\\x94remember your uncle, Mr. Bowling;\\r\\nperhaps he is now on his voyage homeward, pleasing himself with the\\r\\nhopes of seeing and relieving you; nay, peradventure, he has already\\r\\narrived, for the ship was expected about this time.â\\x80\\x9d A ray of hope shot\\r\\nathwart my soul at this suggestion; I thanked my friend for this\\r\\nseasonable recollection, and, after having promised to take no\\r\\nresolution till his return, dismissed him to Wapping for intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his absence I was visited by Banter, who, being informed of my bad\\r\\nluck at play, told me that fortune would probably be one day weary of\\r\\npersecuting me. â\\x80\\x9cIn the meantime,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9chereâ\\x80\\x99s a letter for you,\\r\\nwhich I received just now inclosed in one from Freeman.â\\x80\\x9d I snatched it\\r\\nwith eagerness, and knowing the superscription to be of Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhandwriting, kissed it with transport, and, having opened it, read:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is with great difficulty that I have stolen, from the observation\\r\\nof those spies who are set over me, this opportunity of telling you,\\r\\nthat I was suddenly carried away from Bath by my brother, who was\\r\\ninformed of our correspondence by Lord Quiverwit whom, I since\\r\\nunderstand, you have wounded in a duel on my account. As I am fully\\r\\nconvinced of your honour and love, I hope I shall never hear of such\\r\\ndesperate proofs of either for the future. I am so strictly watched\\r\\nthat it will be impossible for you to see me, until my brotherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsuspicion shall abate, or Heaven contrive some other unforeseen event\\r\\nin our behalf. In the meantime, you may depend on the constancy and\\r\\naffection of\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour own\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNarcissa.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    â\\x80\\x9cP. S. Miss Williams, who is my fellow prisoner, desires to be\\r\\n    remembered to you. We are both in good health, and only in pain for\\r\\n    you, especially as it will be impracticable for you to convey any\\r\\n    message or letter to the place of our confinement; for which reason\\r\\n    pray desist from the attempt, that, by miscarrying, might prolong\\r\\n    our captivity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNâ\\x80\\x94.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis kind letter afforded me great consolation: I communicated it to\\r\\nBanter, and, at the same time, showed him her picture: he approved of\\r\\nher beauty and good sense, and could not help owning that my neglect of\\r\\nMiss Snapper was excusable, when such a fine creature engrossed my\\r\\nattention.\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to be reconciled to my fate, and imagined, that, if I could\\r\\ncontrive means of subsisting until my uncle should arrive, in case he\\r\\nwere not already at home, he would enable me to do something effectual\\r\\nin behalf of my love and fortune; I therefore consulted Banter about a\\r\\npresent supply, who no sooner understood that I had credit, with a\\r\\ntailor, than he advised me to take off two or three suits of rich\\r\\nclothes, and convert them into cash, by selling them at half-price to a\\r\\nsalesman in Monmouth Street. I was startled at this proposal, which I\\r\\nthought savoured a little of fraud; he rendered it palatable, by\\r\\nobserving that, in a few months, I might be in a condition to do\\r\\neverybody justice; and, in the meantime, I was acquitted by the honesty\\r\\nof my intention. I suffered myself to be persuaded by his salvo, by\\r\\nwhich my necessity, rather than my judgment, was convinced; and, when I\\r\\nfound there were no accounts of the ship in which my uncle embarked,\\r\\nactually put the scheme in practice, and raised by it five-and-twenty\\r\\nguineas, paying him for his advice with the old five.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LXI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI am arrestedâ\\x80\\x94carried to the Marshalseaâ\\x80\\x94find my old Acquaintance beau\\r\\nJackson in that Jailâ\\x80\\x94he informs me of his Adventuresâ\\x80\\x94Strap arrives, and\\r\\nwith difficulty is comfortedâ\\x80\\x94Jackson introduces me to a Poetâ\\x80\\x94I admire\\r\\nhis Conversation and Capacityâ\\x80\\x94am deeply affected with my\\r\\nMisfortuneâ\\x80\\x94Strap hires himself as a Journeyman Barber\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this expedient was in a few weeks followed with a consequence I did\\r\\nnot foresee. A player, having purchased one of the suits that were\\r\\nexposed to sale, appeared in it on the stage one night, while my tailor\\r\\nunfortunately happened to be present. He knew it immediately, and,\\r\\ninquiring minutely into the affair, discovered my whole contrivance:\\r\\nupon which he came into my lodgings, and telling me that he was very\\r\\nmuch straightened for want of money, presented his bill, which amounted\\r\\nto fifty pounds. Surprised at which unexpected address, I affected to\\r\\ntreat him cavalierly, swore some oaths, asked if he doubted my honour,\\r\\nand telling him I should take care whom I dealt with for the future,\\r\\nbade him come again in three days. He obeyed me punctually, demanded\\r\\nhis money, and finding himself amused with bare promises, arrested me\\r\\nthat very day in the street. I was not much shocked at this adventure,\\r\\nwhich, indeed, put an end to a state of horrible expectation: but I\\r\\nrefused to go to a sponging-house, where I heard there was nothing but\\r\\nthe most flagrant imposition: and, a coach being called, was carried to\\r\\nthe Marshalsea, attended by a bailiff and his follower, who were very\\r\\nmuch disappointed and chagrined at my resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe turnkey, guessing from my appearance that I had money in my pocket,\\r\\nreceived me with the repetition of the Latin word depone, and gave me\\r\\nto understand, that I must pay beforehand for the apartment I should\\r\\nchoose to dwell in. I desired to see his conveniences, and hired a\\r\\nsmall paltry bed-chamber for a crown a week, which, in any other place,\\r\\nwould not have let for half the money. Having taken possession of this\\r\\ndismal habitation, I sent for Strap, and my thoughts were busied in\\r\\ncollecting matter of consolation to that faithful squire, when somebody\\r\\nknocked at my door, which I no sooner opened, than a young fellow\\r\\nentered in very shabby clothes and marvellous foul linen. After a low\\r\\nbow, he called me by name, and asked if I had forgotten him. His voice\\r\\nassisted me in recollecting his person, whom I soon recognised to be my\\r\\nold acquaintance, Jackson, of whom mention is made in the first part of\\r\\nmy memoirs. I saluted him cordially, expressed my satisfaction at\\r\\nfinding him alive, and condoled him on his present situation, which,\\r\\nhowever, did not seem to affect him much, for he laughed very heartily\\r\\nat the occasion of our meeting so unexpectedly in this place. Our\\r\\nmutual compliments being past, I inquired about his amour with the lady\\r\\nof fortune, which seemed to be so near a happy conclusion when I had\\r\\nthe pleasure of seeing him last: and, after an immoderate fit of\\r\\nlaughter, he gave me to understand that he had been egregiously bit in\\r\\nthat affair. â\\x80\\x9cYou must know,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cthat a few days after our\\r\\nadventure with the bawd, and her bâ\\x80\\x94ches, I found means to be married to\\r\\nthat same blue lady you speak of, and passed the night with her at her\\r\\nlodgings, so much to her satisfaction, that early in the morning, after\\r\\na good deal of snivelling and sobbing, she owned, that, far from being\\r\\nan heiress of great fortune, she was no other than a common woman of\\r\\nthe town, who had decoyed me into matrimony, in order to enjoy the\\r\\nprivilege of a femme couverte; and that, unless I made my escape\\r\\nimmediately, I should be arrested for a debt of her contracting, by\\r\\nbailiffs employed and instructed for that purpose. Startled at this\\r\\nintimation, I rose in a twinkling, and taking leave of my spouse with\\r\\nseveral hearty damns, got safe into the verge of the court, where I\\r\\nkept snug, until I was appointed surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s mate of a man-of-war at\\r\\nPortsmouth; for which place I set out on Sunday, went on board of my\\r\\nship, in which I sailed to the Straits, where I had the good fortune to\\r\\nbe made surgeon of a sloop that came home a few months after, and was\\r\\nput out of commission: whereupon, I came to London, imagining myself\\r\\nforgotten, and freed from my wife and her creditors, but had not been\\r\\nin town a week, before I was arrested for a debt of hers, amounting to\\r\\ntwenty pounds, and brought to this place, where I have been fixed by\\r\\nanother action since that time. However, you know my disposition, I\\r\\ndefy care and anxiety; and being on the half-pay list, make shift to\\r\\nlive here tolerably easy.â\\x80\\x9d I congratulated him on his philosophy, and,\\r\\nremembering that I was in his debt, repaid the money he formerly lent\\r\\nme, which, I believe, was far from being unseasonable. I then inquired\\r\\nabout the economy of the place, which he explained to my satisfaction;\\r\\nand, after we had agreed to mess together, he was just now going to\\r\\ngive orders for dinner when Strap arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nI never in my life saw sorrow so extravagantly expressed in any\\r\\ncountenance as in that of my honest friend, which was, indeed,\\r\\nparticularly adapted by nature for such impressions. When we were left\\r\\nby ourselves, I communicated to him my disaster, and endeavoured to\\r\\nconsole him with the same arguments he had formerly used to me, withal\\r\\nrepresenting the fair chance I had of being relieved in a short time by\\r\\nMr. Bowling. But his grief was unutterable: he seemed to give attention\\r\\nwithout listening, and wrung his hands in silence; so that I was in a\\r\\nfair way of being infected by his behaviour, when Jackson returned,\\r\\nand, perceiving the deference I paid to Strap, although in a footmanâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhabit, distributed his crumbs of comfort with such mirth, jollity and\\r\\nunconcern, that the features of the distressed squire relaxed by\\r\\ndegrees; he recovered the use of speech, and began to be a little more\\r\\nreconciled to this lamentable event. We dined together on boiled beef\\r\\nand greens, brought from a cookâ\\x80\\x99s shop in the neighbourhood, and,\\r\\nalthough this meal was served up in a manner little corresponding with\\r\\nthe sphere of life in which I had lately lived, I made a virtue of\\r\\nnecessity, ate with good appetite, and treated my friends with a bottle\\r\\nof wine, which had the desired effect of increasing the good humour of\\r\\nmy fellow prisoner, and exhilarating the spirits of Strap, who now\\r\\ntalked cavalierly of my misfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner Jackson left us to our private affairs; when I desired my\\r\\nfriend to pack up all our things, and carry them to some cheap lodgings\\r\\nhe should choose for himself in the neighbourhood of the Marshalsea,\\r\\nafter he had discharged my lodgings, for which purpose I gave him\\r\\nmoney. I likewise recommended to him the keeping my misfortune secret,\\r\\nand saying to my landlord, or any other who should inquire for me, that\\r\\nI was gone into the country for a few weeks: at the same time I laid\\r\\nstrong injunctions upon him to call every second day upon Banter, in\\r\\ncase he should receive any letter for me from Narcissa, by the channel\\r\\nof Freeman; and by all means to leave a direction for himself at my\\r\\nuncleâ\\x80\\x99s lodgings in Wapping, by which I might be found when my kinsman\\r\\nshould arrive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he departed to execute these orders (which by the bye were\\r\\npunctually performed that very night), I found myself so little\\r\\nseasoned to my situation, that I dreaded reflection, and sought shelter\\r\\nfrom it in the company of the beau, who, promising to regale me with a\\r\\nlecture upon taste, conducted me to the common side, where I saw a\\r\\nnumber of naked miserable wretches assembled together. We had not been\\r\\nhere many minutes, when a figure appeared, wrapped in a dirty rug, tied\\r\\nabout his loins with two pieces of list, of different colours, knotted\\r\\ntogether; having a black bushy beard, and his head covered with a huge\\r\\nmass of brown periwig, which seems to have been ravished from the crown\\r\\nof some scarecrow. This apparition, stalking in with great solemnity,\\r\\nmade a profound bow to the audience, who signified their approbation by\\r\\na general response of â\\x80\\x9cHow dâ\\x80\\x99ye do, doctor!â\\x80\\x9d He then turned towards us,\\r\\nand honoured Jackson with a particular salutation, upon which my\\r\\nfriend, in a formal manner, introduced him to me by the name of Mr.\\r\\nMelopoyn. This ceremony being over, he advanced into the middle of the\\r\\ncongregation, which crowded around him, and hemming three times, to my\\r\\nutter astonishment, pronounced with great significance of voice and\\r\\ngesture, a very elegant and ingenious discourse upon the difference\\r\\nbetween genius and taste, illustrating his assertions with apt\\r\\nquotations from the best authors, ancient as well as modern. When he\\r\\nhad finished his harangue, which lasted a full hour, he bowed again to\\r\\nthe spectators; not one of whom (I was informed) understood so much as\\r\\na sentence of what he had uttered. They manifested, however, their\\r\\nadmiration and esteem by voluntary contributions, which Jackson told\\r\\nme, one week with another, amounted to eighteen pence. This moderate\\r\\nstipend, together with some small presents that he received for making\\r\\nup differences and deciding causes amongst the prisoners, just enabled\\r\\nhim to breathe and walk about in the grotesque figure I have described.\\r\\nI understood also, that he was an excellent poet, and had composed a\\r\\ntragedy, which was allowed by everybody who had seen it to be a\\r\\nperformance of great merit: that his learning was infinite, his morals\\r\\nunexceptionable, and his modesty invincible. Such a character could not\\r\\nfail of attracting my regard; I longed impatiently to be acquainted\\r\\nwith him, and desired Jackson would engage him to spend the evening in\\r\\nmy apartment. My request was granted; he favoured us with his company,\\r\\nand, in the course of our conversation perceiving that I had a strong\\r\\npassion for the Belles Lettres, acquitted himself so well on that\\r\\nsubject, that I expressed a fervent desire of seeing his productions.\\r\\nIn this point too he gratified my inclination; he promised to bring his\\r\\ntragedy to my room next day, and in the meantime, entertained me with\\r\\nsome detached pieces, which gave me a very advantageous idea of his\\r\\npoetical talent. Among other things I was particularly pleased with\\r\\nsome elegies, in imitation of Tibullus; one of which I beg leave to\\r\\nsubmit to the reader as a specimen of his complexion and capacity:â\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\r\\n    Where now are all my flattering dreams of joy?\\r\\nMonimia, give my soul her wonted rest;â\\x80\\x94\\r\\n    Since first thy beauty fixed my roving eye,\\r\\nheart-gnawing cares corrode my pensive breast!\\r\\n\\r\\n    Let happy lovers fly where pleasures call,\\r\\nWith festive songs beguile the fleeting hour,\\r\\n    Lead beauty through the mazes of the ball,\\r\\nOr press her wanton in loveâ\\x80\\x99s roseate bower:\\r\\n\\r\\n    For me, no more Iâ\\x80\\x99ll range the empurpled mead,\\r\\nWhere shepherdâ\\x80\\x99s pipe and virgins dance around,\\r\\n    Nor wander through the woodbineâ\\x80\\x99s fragrant shade,\\r\\nTo hear the music of the grove resound.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Iâ\\x80\\x99ll seek some lonely church, or dreary hall,\\r\\nWhere fancy paints the glimmering taper blue,\\r\\n    Where damps hang mouldering on the ivyâ\\x80\\x99d wall,\\r\\nAnd sheeted ghosts drink up the midnight dew,\\r\\n\\r\\n    There, leagued with hopeless anguish and despair,\\r\\nA while in silence oâ\\x80\\x99er my fate repair:\\r\\n    Then, with a long farewell to love and care,\\r\\nTo kindred dust my weary limbs consign.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Wilt thou, Monimia, shed a gracious tear\\r\\nOn the cold grave where all my sorrows rest?\\r\\n    Strew vernal flowers, applaud my love sincere,\\r\\nAnd bid the turf lie easy on my breast?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI was wonderfully affected with this pathetic complaint, which seemed\\r\\nso well calculated for my own disappointment in love, that I could not\\r\\nhelp attaching the idea of Narcissa to the name of Monimia, and of\\r\\nforming such melancholy presages of my passion, that I could not\\r\\nrecover my tranquillity: and was fain to have recourse to the bottle,\\r\\nwhich prepared me for a profound sleep that I could not otherwise have\\r\\nenjoyed. Whether these impressions invited and introduced a train of\\r\\nother melancholy reflections, or my fortitude was all exhausted in the\\r\\neffort I made against despondence, during the first day of my\\r\\nimprisonment, I cannot determine; but I awoke in the horrors, and found\\r\\nmy imagination haunted with such dismal apparitions, that I was ready\\r\\nto despair: and I believe the reader will own, I had no great cause to\\r\\ncongratulate myself, when I considered my situation. I was interrupted\\r\\nin the midst of these gloomy apprehensions by the arrival of Strap, who\\r\\ncontributed not a little to the re-establishment of my peace, by\\r\\nletting me know that he had hired himself as a journeyman barber; by\\r\\nwhich means he would be able not only to save me a considerable\\r\\nexpense, but even make shift to lay up something for my subsistence,\\r\\nafter my money should be spent, in case I should not be relieved\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LXII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI read Melopoynâ\\x80\\x99s Tragedy, and conceive a vast Opinion of his Geniusâ\\x80\\x94he\\r\\nrecounts his Adventures\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we ate our breakfast together, I made him acquainted with the\\r\\ncharacter and condition of the poet, who came in with his play at that\\r\\ninstant, and, imagining we were engaged about business, could not be\\r\\nprevailed upon to sit; but, leaving his performance, went away. My\\r\\nfriendâ\\x80\\x99s tender heart was melted at the sight of a gentleman and\\r\\nChristian (for he had a great veneration for both these epithets) in\\r\\nsuch misery; and assented with great cheerfulness to a proposal I made\\r\\nof clothing him with the our superfluities; a task with which he\\r\\ncharged himself, and departed immediately to perform it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was no sooner gone than I locked my door, and sat down to the\\r\\ntragedy; which I read to the end with vast pleasure, not a little\\r\\namazed at conduct of the managers who had rejected it. The fable, in my\\r\\nopinion, was well chosen and naturally conducted, the incidents\\r\\ninteresting, the characters beautifully contrasted, strongly marked,\\r\\nand well supported; the diction poetical, spirited and correct; the\\r\\nunities of the drama maintained with the most scrupulous exactness; the\\r\\nopening gradual and engaging, the peripeteia surprising, and the\\r\\ncatastrophe affecting. In short, I judged it by the laws of Aristotle\\r\\nand Horace, and could find nothing in it exceptionable but a little too\\r\\nmuch embellishment in some few places, which objection he removed to my\\r\\nsatisfaction, by a quotation of Aristotleâ\\x80\\x99s _Poetics_, importing, that\\r\\nthe least interesting parts of a poem ought to be raised and dignified\\r\\nby the charms and energy of diction.\\r\\n\\r\\nI revered his genius, and was seized with an eager curiosity to know\\r\\nthe particular events of a fortune so unworthy of his merit. At that\\r\\ninstant Strap returned with a bundle of clothes, which I sent with my\\r\\ncompliments to Mr. Melopoyn, as a small token of my regard, and desired\\r\\nthe favour of his company to dinner. He accepted my present and\\r\\ninvitation, and in less than half-an-hour made his appearance in a\\r\\ndecent dress, which altered his figure very much to his advantage. I\\r\\nperceived by his countenance that his heart was big with gratitude, and\\r\\nendeavoured to prevent his acknowledgments, by asking pardon for the\\r\\nliberty I had taken; he made no reply, but, with an aspect full of\\r\\nadmiration and esteem, bowed to the ground, while the tears gushed from\\r\\nhis eyes. Affected with these symptoms of an ingenuous mind, I shifted\\r\\nthe conversation, and complimented him on his performance, which I\\r\\nassured him afforded me infinite pleasure. My approbation made him\\r\\nhappy. Dinner being served, and Jackson arrived, I begged their\\r\\npermission for Strap to sit at table with us, after having informed\\r\\nthem that he was a person to whom I was extremely obliged; they were\\r\\nkind enough to grant that favour, and we ate together with great\\r\\nharmony and satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur meal being ended, I expressed my wonder at the little regard Mr.\\r\\nMelopoyn had met with from the world: and signified a desire of hearing\\r\\nhow he had been treated by the managers of the playhouses, to whom I\\r\\nunderstood from Jackson, he had offered his tragedy without success.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is so little entertaining in the incidents of my life,â\\x80\\x9d said he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat I am sure the recital will not recompense your attention; but,\\r\\nsince you discover an inclination to know them I understand my duty too\\r\\nwell to disappoint your desire.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy father, who was a curate in the country, being by the narrowness of\\r\\nhis circumstances hindered from maintaining me at the university, took\\r\\nthe charge of my education upon himself, and laboured with such\\r\\nindustry and concern in the undertaking, that I had little cause to\\r\\nregret the want of public masters. Being at great pains to consult my\\r\\nnatural bias, He discovered in me betimes an inclination for poetry;\\r\\nupon which he recommended to me an intimate acquaintance with the\\r\\nclassics, in the cultivation of which he assisted me with a paternal\\r\\nzeal and uncommon erudition. When he thought me sufficiently acquainted\\r\\nwith the ancients, he directed my studies to the best modern authors,\\r\\nFrench and Italian as well as English, and laid a particular injunction\\r\\nupon me make myself master of my mother tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout the age of eighteen, I grew ambitious of undertaking a work of\\r\\nsome consequence; and, with my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s approbation, actually planned\\r\\nthe tragedy you have read; but, before I had finished four acts, that\\r\\nindulgent parent died, and left my mother and me in very indigent\\r\\ncircumstances. A near relation, compassionating our distress, took us\\r\\ninto his family, where I brought my fable to a conclusion; and, soon\\r\\nafter that period my mother quitted this life. When my sorrow for this\\r\\nmelancholy event had subsided, I told my kinsman, who was a farmer,\\r\\nthat, having paid my last duty to my parent, I had now no attachment to\\r\\ndetain me in the country, and therefore was resolved to set out for\\r\\nLondon, and offer my play to the stage, where I did not doubt of\\r\\nacquiring a large share of fame as well as fortune; in which case I\\r\\nshould not be unmindful of my friends and benefactors. My cousin was\\r\\nravished with the prospect of my felicity, and willingly contributed\\r\\ntowards the expense of fitting me out for my expedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAccordingly I took a place in the waggon, and arrived in town, where I\\r\\nhired an apartment in a garret, willing to live as frugally as\\r\\npossible, until I should know what I had to expect from the manager, to\\r\\nwhom I intended to offer my play. For, though I looked upon myself as\\r\\nperfectly secure of a good reception, imagining that a patentee would\\r\\nbe as eager to receive as I to present my production, I did not know\\r\\nwhether or not he might be pre-engaged in favour of another author, a\\r\\ncircumstance that would certainly retard my success. On this\\r\\nconsideration, too, I determined to be speedy in my application, and\\r\\neven to wait upon one of the managers the very next day. For this\\r\\npurpose, I inquired my landlord if he knew where either or both of them\\r\\nlived: and he, being curious to know my business, and at the same time\\r\\nappearing to be a very honest friendly man (a tallow chandler), I made\\r\\nhim acquainted with my design, upon which he told me that I went the\\r\\nwrong way to work; that I would not find such easy access to a manager\\r\\nas I imagined; and that if I delivered my performance without proper\\r\\nrecommendation, it would be as one to a thousand if ever it would be\\r\\nminded. â\\x80\\x9cTake my advice,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cand your business is done. One of\\r\\nthe patentees is a good catholic, as I am, and uses the same father who\\r\\nconfesses me. I will make you acquainted with this good priest, who is\\r\\nan excellent scholar, and if he should approve of your play, his\\r\\nrecommendation will go a great way in determining Mr. Supple to bring\\r\\nit on the stage.â\\x80\\x9d I applauded his expedient, and was introduced to the\\r\\nfriar, who, having perused the tragedy, was pleased to signify his\\r\\napprobation, and commended me in particular for having avoided all\\r\\nreflections upon religion. He promised to use all his influence with\\r\\nhis son Supple in my behalf, and to inform himself that very day at\\r\\nwhat time it was proper for me to wait upon him with the piece. He was\\r\\npunctual in performing his engagement, and next morning gave me to\\r\\nunderstand that he had mentioned my affair to the manager, and that I\\r\\nhad nothing more to do than to go to his house any time in the\\r\\nforenoon, and make use of his name, upon which I should find immediate\\r\\nadmittance. I took his advice, put my performance in my bosom, and,\\r\\nhaving received directions, went immediately to the house of Mr.\\r\\nSupple, and knocked at the door, which had a wicket in the middle,\\r\\nfaced with a net-work of iron. Through this a servant having viewed me\\r\\nfor some time, demanded to know my business. I told him my business was\\r\\nwith Mr. Supple, and that I came from Mr. Oâ\\x80\\x99Varnish. He examined my\\r\\nappearance once more, then went away, returned in a few minutes, and\\r\\nsaid his master was busy, and could not be seen. Although I was a\\r\\nlittle mortified at my disappointment, I was persuaded that my\\r\\nreception was owing to Mr. Suppleâ\\x80\\x99s ignorance of my errand: and, that I\\r\\nmight meet with no more obstructions of the same kind, I desired Mr.\\r\\nOâ\\x80\\x99Varnish to be my introductor the next time. He complied with my\\r\\nrequest, and obtained immediate admittance to the manager, who received\\r\\nme with the utmost civility, and promised to read my play with the\\r\\nfirst convenience. By his own appointment I called again in a\\r\\nfortnight, but he was gone out: I returned in a week after, and the\\r\\npoor gentleman was extremely ill: I renewed my visit in a fortnight\\r\\nafter that, and he assured me he had been so much fatigued with\\r\\nbusiness, that he had not been able as yet to read it to an end, but he\\r\\nwould take the first opportunity: and, in the meantime, observed that\\r\\nwhat he had yet seen of it was very entertaining. I comforted myself\\r\\nwith this declaration a few weeks longer, at the end of which I\\r\\nappeared again before his wicket, was let in, and found him laid up\\r\\nwith the gout. I no sooner entered his chamber than, looking at me with\\r\\na languishing eye, he said, â\\x80\\x9cMr. Melopoyn, Iâ\\x80\\x99m heartily sorry for an\\r\\naccident that has happened during my illness. You must know that my\\r\\neldest boy, finding your manuscript upon the table in the dining-room,\\r\\nwhere I used to read it, carried it into the kitchen, and leaving it\\r\\nthere, a negligent wench of a cook-maid, mistaking it for waste paper,\\r\\nhas expended it but a few leaves in singing fowls upon the spit. But I\\r\\nhope the misfortune is not irreparable, since, no doubt, you have\\r\\nseveral copies.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI protest to you, my good friend, Mr. Random, I was extremely shocked\\r\\nat this information; but the good-natured gentleman seemed to be so\\r\\nmuch affected with my misfortune, that I suppressed my concern, and\\r\\ntold him that, although I had not another copy, I should be able to\\r\\nretrieve the loss by writing another from my memory, which was very\\r\\ntenacious. You cannot imagine how well pleased Mr. Supple was at this\\r\\nassurance; he begged I would set about it immediately, and carefully\\r\\nrevolve and recollect every circumstance before I pretended to commit\\r\\nit to paper, that it might be the same individual play that he had\\r\\nperused. Encouraged by this injunction, which plainly demonstrated how\\r\\nmuch he interested himself in the affair, I tasked my remembrance and\\r\\nindustry, and in three weeks produced the exact image of the former,\\r\\nwhich was conveyed to him by my good friend Father Oâ\\x80\\x99Varnish, who told\\r\\nme next day, that Mr. Supple would revise it superficially, in order to\\r\\njudge of its sameness with the other, and then give his final answer.\\r\\nFor this examination I allotted a week: and, in full confidence of\\r\\nseeing it acted in a little while, demanded an audience of the manager,\\r\\nwhen that term was expired. But, alas! the season had slipped away\\r\\ninsensibly. He convinced me, that if my play had been put into\\r\\nrehearsal at the time, it could not have been ready for performing\\r\\nuntil the end of March, when the benefit nights came on; consequently,\\r\\nit would have interfered with the interest of the players, whom it was\\r\\nnot my business to disoblige.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was fain to acquiesce in these reasons, which, to be sure, were\\r\\nextremely just; and to reserve my performance for the next season, when\\r\\nhe hoped I would not be so unlucky. Although it was a grievous\\r\\ndisappointment to me, who, by this time, began to want both money and\\r\\nnecessaries; having on the strength of my expectation from the theatre,\\r\\nlaunched out into some extravagances, by which the sum I brought to\\r\\ntown was already almost consumed. Indeed, I ought to be ashamed at this\\r\\ncircumstance of my conduct; for my finances were sufficient, with good\\r\\neconomy, to have maintained me comfortably a whole year. You will\\r\\nperhaps be amazed when I tell you that, in six months, I expended not a\\r\\nfarthing less than ten guineas: but, when one considers the temptations\\r\\nto which a young man is exposed in this great city, especially if he be\\r\\naddicted to pleasure, as I am, the wonder will vanish, or at least\\r\\nabate. Nor was the cause of my concern limited to my own situation\\r\\nentirely: I had written an account of my good reception to my kinsman\\r\\nthe farmer, and desired him to depend upon me for the money he had\\r\\nkindly accommodated me with about the end of February, which promise I\\r\\nnow found myself unable to perform. However, there was no remedy but\\r\\npatience: I applied to my landlord, who was a very good-natured man,\\r\\ncandidly owned my distress, and begged his advice in laying down some\\r\\nplan for my subsistence; he readily promised to consult his confessor\\r\\non this subject, and, in the meantime, told me, I was welcome to lodge\\r\\nand board with him until fortune should put it in my power to make\\r\\nrestitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Oâ\\x80\\x99Varnish, being informed of my necessity, offered to introduce me\\r\\nto the author of a weekly paper, who, he did not doubt, would employ me\\r\\nin that way, provided he should find me duly qualified; but, upon\\r\\ninquiry, I understood that this journal was calculated to foment\\r\\ndivisions in the commonwealth, and therefore I desired to be excused\\r\\nfrom engaging in it. He then proposed that I should write something in\\r\\nthe poetical way, which I might dispose of to a bookseller for a pretty\\r\\nsum of ready money, and, perhaps, establish my own character into the\\r\\nbargain. This event would infallibly procure friends, and my tragedy\\r\\nwould appear next season to the best advantage, by being supported both\\r\\nby interest and reputation. I was charmed with this prospect, and\\r\\nhaving heard what friends Mr. Pope acquired by his pastorals, set about\\r\\na work of that kind, and in less than six weeks composed as many\\r\\neclogues, which I forthwith offered to an eminent bookseller, who\\r\\ndesired me to leave them for his perusal, and he would give an answer\\r\\nin two days. At the end of that time, I went to him, when he returned\\r\\nthe poems, telling me, they would not answer his purpose, and sweetened\\r\\nhis refusal by saying there were some good clever lines in them. Not a\\r\\nlittle dejected at this rebuff, which, I learned from Mr. Oâ\\x80\\x99Varnish,\\r\\nwas owing to the opinion of another author whom this bookseller always\\r\\nconsulted on these occasions, I applied to another person of the same\\r\\nprofession, who told me the town was cloyed with pastorals, and advised\\r\\nme, if I intended to profit by my talents, to write something satirical\\r\\nor luscious, such as the Button Hole, Shockey and Towner, The Leaky\\r\\nVessel, etc, and yet this was a man in years, who wore a reverend\\r\\nperiwig, looked like a senator, and went regularly to church. Be that\\r\\nas it will, I scorned to prostitute my pen in the manner proposed, and\\r\\ncarried my papers to a third, who assured me that poetry was entirely\\r\\nout of his way; and asked me if I had got never a piece of secret\\r\\nhistory, thrown into a series of letters, or a volume of adventures,\\r\\nsuch as those of Robinson Crusoe, and Colonel Jack, or a collection of\\r\\nConundrums, wherewith to entertain the plantations. Being quite\\r\\nunfurnished for this dealer, I had recourse to another with as little\\r\\nsuccess; and I verily believe, was rejected by the whole trade.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was afterwards persuaded to offer myself as a translator, and\\r\\naccordingly repaired to a person who was said to entertain numbers of\\r\\nthat class in his pay; he assured me, he had already a great deal of\\r\\nthat work on his hands, which he did not know what to do with; observed\\r\\nthat translations were a mere drug, that branch of literature being\\r\\noverstocked with an inundation of authors from North Britain; and asked\\r\\nwhat I would expect per sheet for rendering the Latin classics into\\r\\nEnglish. That I might not make myself too cheap, I determined to set a\\r\\nhigh price upon my qualifications, and demanded half-a-guinea for every\\r\\ntranslated sheet. â\\x80\\x9cHalf-a-guinea!â\\x80\\x9d cried he, staring at me; then paused\\r\\na little, and said, he had no occasion for my service at present. I\\r\\nfound my error, and, resolving to make amends, fell one-half in my\\r\\ndemand; upon which he stared at me and told me his hands were full. I\\r\\nattempted others without finding employment, and was actually reduced\\r\\nto a very uncomfortable prospect, when I bethought myself of offering\\r\\nmy talents to the printers of half-penny ballads and other such\\r\\noccasional essays, as are hawked about the streets. With this in view I\\r\\napplied to one of the most noted and vociferous of this tribe, who\\r\\ndirected me to a person whom I found entertaining a whole crowd of them\\r\\nwith gin, bread, and cheese; he carried me into a little back parlour,\\r\\nvery neatly furnished, where I signified my desire of being enrolled\\r\\namong his writers; and was asked what kind of composition I professed.\\r\\nUnderstanding that my inclination leaned towards poetry, he expressed\\r\\nhis satisfaction, telling me one of his poets had lost his senses, and\\r\\nwas confined in Bedlam, and the other was become dozed with drinking\\r\\ndrams; so that he had not done anything tolerable these many weeks.\\r\\nWhen I proposed that we should enter into terms of agreement, he gave\\r\\nme to understand that his bargains were always conditional, and his\\r\\nauthors paid in proportion to the sale of their works.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHaving therefore settled these conditions, which (I do assure you)\\r\\nwere not very advantageous to me, he assigned me a subject for a\\r\\nballad, which was to be finished in two hours; and I retired to my\\r\\ngarret in order to perform his injunction. As the theme happened to\\r\\nsuit my fancy, I completed a pretty sort of an ode within the time\\r\\nprescribed, and brought it to him, big with hope of profit and\\r\\napplause. He read it in a twinkling, and, to my utter astonishment,\\r\\ntold me it would not do; though indeed he owned I wrote a good hand,\\r\\nand spelled very well, but my language was too high flown, and of\\r\\nconsequence not at all adapted to the capacity and taste of his\\r\\ncustomers. I promised to rectify that mistake and in half an hour\\r\\nhumbled my style to the comprehension of vulgar readers; he approved of\\r\\nthe alteration, and gave me some hopes of succeeding in time, though he\\r\\nobserved that my performance was very deficient in the quaintness of\\r\\nexpression that pleases the multitude: however, to encourage me, he\\r\\nventured the expense of printing and paper, and, if I remember aright,\\r\\nmy share of the sale amounted to fourpence halfpenny.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrom that day I studied the Grub Street manner with great diligence,\\r\\nand at length became such a proficient that my works were in great\\r\\nrequest among the most polite of the chairmen, draymen,\\r\\nhackney-coachmen, footmen, and servant maids: nay, I have enjoyed the\\r\\npleasure of seeing my productions adorned with cuts, pasted upon the\\r\\nwalls as ornaments in beer cellars and cobblersâ\\x80\\x99 stalls; and have\\r\\nactually heard them sung in clubs of substantial tradesmenâ\\x80\\x94but empty\\r\\npraise (you know, my dear friend) will not supply the cravings of\\r\\nnature. I found myself in danger of starving in the midst of all my\\r\\nfame; for of ten songs I composed, it was well if two had the good\\r\\nfortune to please. For this reason I turned my thoughts to prose, and,\\r\\nduring a tract of gloomy weather, published an apparition, on the\\r\\nsubstance of which I subsisted very comfortably a whole month; I have\\r\\nmade many a good meal upon a monster; a rape has often afforded me\\r\\ngreat satisfaction; but a murder, well timed, was my never-failing\\r\\nresource. What then? I was almost a slave to my employers, who expected\\r\\nto be furnished at a minuteâ\\x80\\x99s warning with prose and verse, just as\\r\\nthey thought the circumstances of the times required, whether the\\r\\ninclination was absent or present. Upon my sincerity, Mr. Random, I\\r\\nhave been so much pestered and besieged by those children of clamour,\\r\\nthat life became a burden to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LXIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Continuation and Conclusion of Mr. Melopoynâ\\x80\\x99s Story\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x98I made shift, notwithstanding, to maintain myself till the beginning\\r\\nof next winter, when I renewed my addresses to my friend Mr. Supple,\\r\\nand was most graciously received. â\\x80\\x9cI have been thinking of your affair,\\r\\nMr. Melopoyn,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cand am determined to show how far I have your\\r\\ninterest at heart, by introducing you to a young nobleman of my\\r\\nacquaintance, who is remarkable for his fine taste in dramatic\\r\\nwritings, and is besides a man of such influence that, if once he\\r\\nshould approve of your play, his patronage will support it against all\\r\\nthe efforts of envy and ignorance; for, I do assure you, that merit\\r\\nalone will not bring success. I have already spoken of your performance\\r\\nto Lord Rattle, and if you will call at my house in a day or two, you\\r\\nshall have a letter of introduction to his lordship.â\\x80\\x9d I was sensibly\\r\\ntouched with this mark of Mr. Suppleâ\\x80\\x99s friendship; and looking upon my\\r\\naffair as already done, went home and imparted my good fortune to my\\r\\nlandlord, who, to render my appearance more acceptable to my patron,\\r\\nprocured a suit of new clothes for me on his own credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot to trouble you with idle particulars, I carried my tragedy to his\\r\\nlordshipâ\\x80\\x99s lodgings, and sent it up along with Mr. Suppleâ\\x80\\x99s letter by\\r\\none of his servants, who desired me, by his lordâ\\x80\\x99s order, to return in\\r\\na week. I did so, and was admitted to his lordship, who received me\\r\\nvery courteously, told me he had perused my play, which he thought, on\\r\\nthe whole, was the best coup dâ\\x80\\x99essai he had ever seen; but that he had\\r\\nmarked some places in the margin, which he imagined might be altered\\r\\nfor the better. I was transported with this reception, and promised\\r\\n(with many acknowledgments of his lordshipâ\\x80\\x99s generosity) to be governed\\r\\nsolely by his advice and direction.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, then,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cwrite another fair copy with the alterations I\\r\\nhave proposed, and bring it to me as soon as possible; for I am\\r\\nresolved to have it brought on the stage this winter.â\\x80\\x9d You may be sure\\r\\nI set about this task with alacrity; and although I found his\\r\\nlordshipâ\\x80\\x99s remarks much more numerous and of less importance than I\\r\\nexpected, I thought it was not my interest to dispute upon trifles with\\r\\nmy patron; therefore new modelled it according to his desire in less\\r\\nthan a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I waited upon him with the manuscript, I found one of the actors\\r\\nat breakfast with his lordship, who immediately introduced him to my\\r\\nacquaintance, and desired him to read a scene of my play. This task he\\r\\nperformed very much to my satisfaction, with regard to emphasis and\\r\\npronunciation; but he signified his disgust at several words in every\\r\\npage, which I presuming to defend, Lord Rattle told me, with a\\r\\nperemptory look, I must not pretend to dispute with him, who had been a\\r\\nplayer these twenty years, and understood the economy of the stage\\r\\nbetter than any man living. I was forced to submit; and his lordship\\r\\nproposed the same actor should read the whole play in the evening,\\r\\nbefore some gentlemen of his acquaintance, whom he would convene to his\\r\\nlodgings for that purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was present at the reading; and I protest to you, my dear friend, I\\r\\nnever underwent such a severe trial in the whole course of my life at\\r\\nthat juncture; for although the player might be a very honest man and a\\r\\ngood performer, he was excessively illiterate and assuming, and made a\\r\\nthousand frivolous objections, which I was not permitted to answer.\\r\\nHowever, the piece was very much applauded on the whole; the gentlemen\\r\\npresent, who, I understood, were men of fortune, promised to\\r\\ncountenance and support it as much as they could; and Lord Rattle,\\r\\nassuring me that he would act the part of a careful nurse to it,\\r\\ndesired me to carry it home, and alter it immediately according to\\r\\ntheir remarks. I was fain to acquiesce in his determination, and\\r\\nfulfilled his injunctions with all the expedition in my power; but,\\r\\nbefore I could present the new copy, my good friend Mr. Supple had\\r\\ndisposed of his property and patent to one Mr. Brayer; so that fresh\\r\\ninterest was to be made with the new manager. This task Lord Rattle\\r\\nundertook, having some acquaintance with him, and recommended my\\r\\nperformance so strongly that it was received.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI looked upon myself now as upon the eve of reaping the fruits of all\\r\\nmy labour. I waited a few days in expectation of its being put in\\r\\nrehearsal, and wondering at the delay, applied to my worthy patron, who\\r\\nexcused Mr. Brayer on account of the multiplicity of business in which\\r\\nhe was involved, and bade me beware of teasing the patentee. I\\r\\ntreasured up this caution, and exerted my particular three weeks\\r\\nlonger; at the end of which his lordship gave me to understand that Mr.\\r\\nBrayer had read my play, and owned it had indubitable merit; but, as he\\r\\nhad long been pre-engaged to another author, he could not possibly\\r\\nrepresent it that season; though, if I would reserve it for the next,\\r\\nand in the interim make such alterations as he had proposed by\\r\\nobservations on the margin, I might depend upon his compliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThunderstruck at this disappointment, I could not, for some minutes,\\r\\nutter one syllable. At length, however, I complained bitterly of the\\r\\nmanagerâ\\x80\\x99s insincerity in amusing me so long, when he knew from the\\r\\nbeginning that he could not gratify my desire. But his lordship\\r\\nreprimanded me for my freedom, said Mr. Brayer was a man of honour, and\\r\\nimputed his behaviour with respect to me nothing else but\\r\\nforgetfulness. And indeed I have had some reason, since that time, to\\r\\nbe convinced of his bad memory; for, in spite of appearances, I will\\r\\nnot allow myself to interpret his conduct in any other way. Lord Rattle\\r\\nobserving me very much affected with my disappointment, offered his\\r\\ninterest to bring on my play at the other house, which I eagerly\\r\\naccepting, he forthwith wrote a letter of recommendation to Mr.\\r\\nBellower, actor and prime minister to Mr. Vandal, proprietor of that\\r\\ntheatre, and desired me to deliver it with my tragedy, without loss of\\r\\ntime. Accordingly, I hastened to his house, where after having waited a\\r\\nwhole hour in the lobby, I was admitted to his presence, and my\\r\\nperformance received with great state. He told me he was extremely busy\\r\\nat present, but he would peruse it as soon as possible, and bade me to\\r\\ncall again in a week. I took my leave, not a little astonished at the\\r\\npert and supercilious behaviour of this stage player, who had not\\r\\ntreated me with good manners; and began to think the dignity of a poet\\r\\ngreatly impaired since the days of Euripides and Sophocles; but all\\r\\nthis was nothing in comparison of what I have since observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, Mr. Random, I went back at the appointed time, and was told that\\r\\nMr. Bellower was engaged, and could not see me, I repeated my visit a\\r\\nfew days after, and having waited a considerable time was favoured with\\r\\nan audience, during which, he said, he had not as yet read my play.\\r\\nNettled at this usage, I could contain myself no longer, but, telling\\r\\nhim, I imagined he would have paid more deference to Lord Rattleâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nrecommendation, demanded my manuscript with some expression of\\r\\nresentment. â\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said he in a theatrical tone, â\\x80\\x9cwith all my heart.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThen pulling out the drawer of the bureau at which he sat, he took out\\r\\na bundle, and threw it upon a table that was near him, pronouncing the\\r\\nword, â\\x80\\x9cThere!â\\x80\\x9d with great disdain. I took it up, and perceiving with\\r\\nsome surprise, that it was a comedy, told him it did not belong to me;\\r\\nupon which he offered another which I also disclaimed. A third was\\r\\nproduced, and rejected for the same reason. At length he pulled out a\\r\\nwhole bundle, and spread them before me, saying, â\\x80\\x9cThere are sevenâ\\x80\\x94take\\r\\nwhich you pleaseâ\\x80\\x94or take them all.â\\x80\\x9d I singled out my own, and went\\r\\naway, struck dumb with admiration at what I had seenâ\\x80\\x94not so much on\\r\\naccount of his insolence, as of the number of new plays which from this\\r\\ncircumstance I concluded were yearly offered to the stage. You may be\\r\\nsure, I did not fail to carry my complaint to my patron, who did not\\r\\nreceive it with all the indignation I expected; but taxed me with\\r\\nprecipitation, and told me I must lay my account with bearing with the\\r\\nhumours of the players, if I intended to write for the stage. â\\x80\\x9cThere is\\r\\nnow no other remedy,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cbut to keep it till the next season for\\r\\nMr. Brayer, and alter it at your leisure, in the summer, according to\\r\\nhis directions.â\\x80\\x9d I was now reduced to a terrible alternative, either to\\r\\nquit all hopes of my tragedy, from which I had all along promised\\r\\nmyself a large share of fortune and reputation, or to encounter eight\\r\\nlong months of adversity in preparing for and expecting its appearance.\\r\\nThis last penance, painful as it was, seemed most eligible to my\\r\\nreflection at that time, and therefore I resolved to undergo it.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy should I tire you with particulars of my consequence? I wrestled\\r\\nwith extreme poverty until the time of my probation was expired; and\\r\\nwent to my Lord Rattle in order to remind him of my affair, when I\\r\\nunderstood, to my great concern, that his lordship was just on the\\r\\npoint of going abroad, and which was still more unfortunate for me, Mr.\\r\\nBrayer had gone into the country; so that my generous patron had it not\\r\\nin his power to introduce me personally, as he intended: however, he\\r\\nwrote a very strong letter to the manager in my favour, and put him in\\r\\nmind of the promise he had made in behalf of my play.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs soon as I was certified of Brayerâ\\x80\\x99s return, I went to his house\\r\\nwith this letter, but was told he was gone out. I called again next day\\r\\nearly in the morning, received the same answer, and was desired to\\r\\nleave my name and business: I did so, and returned the day after, when\\r\\nthe servant still affirmed that his master was gone abroad; though I\\r\\nperceived him, as I retired, observing me through a window. Incensed at\\r\\nthis discovery, I went to a coffee-house hard by, and, inclosing his\\r\\nlordshipâ\\x80\\x99s letter in one from myself, demanded a categorical answer. I\\r\\nsent it to his house by a porter, who returned in a few minutes, and\\r\\ntold me Mr. Brayer would be glad to see me at that instant. I obeyed\\r\\nthe summons, and was received with such profusion of compliments and\\r\\napologies, that my resentment immediately subsided, and I was even in\\r\\npain for the concern which this holiest man showed at the mistake of\\r\\nhis servant, who, it seems, had been ordered to deny him to everybody\\r\\nbut me. He expressed the utmost veneration for his good and noble\\r\\nfriend, Lord Rattle, whom he should always be proud to serve; promised\\r\\nto peruse the play with all dispatch, and give me a meeting upon it:\\r\\nand, as a testimony of his esteem, made me a present of a general order\\r\\nfor the season, by which I should be admitted to any part of the\\r\\ntheatre. This was a very agreeable compliment to me, whose greatest\\r\\npleasure consisted in seeing dramatic performances, and you need not\\r\\ndoubt that I often availed myself of my privilege. As I had an\\r\\nopportunity of being behind the scenes when I pleased, I frequently\\r\\nconversed with Mr. Brayer about my play, and asked when he meant to put\\r\\nit into rehearsal; but he had always so much business upon his hands,\\r\\nthat it remained with him unopened a considerable while; and I became\\r\\nvery uneasy about the season, that wasted apace, when I saw in the\\r\\npapers another new play advertised, which had been written, offered,\\r\\naccepted, and rehearsed, in the compass of three months. You may easily\\r\\nguess how much I was confounded at this event! I own to you that, in\\r\\nthe first transports of my anger, I suspected Mr. Brayer of having\\r\\nacted towards me in the most pitiful perfidious manner; and was\\r\\nactually glad at his disappointment in the success of his favourite\\r\\npiece, which, by the strength of art, lingered till the third night,\\r\\nand then died in a deplorable manner. But now that passion has no share\\r\\nin my reflection, I am willing to ascribe his behaviour to his want of\\r\\nmemory or want of judgment, which, you know, are natural defects, that\\r\\nare more worthy of compassion than reproach.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbout this time I happened to be in company with a gentlewoman, who,\\r\\nhaving heard of my tragedy, told me, she was well acquainted with the\\r\\nwife of a gentleman who was very well known to a lady, who had great\\r\\ninterest with a person who was intimate with Earl Sheerwit: and that,\\r\\nif I pleased, she would use her influence in my behalf. As this\\r\\nnobleman had the character of a Maecenas in the nation, and could stamp\\r\\na value upon any work by his sole countenance and approbation, I\\r\\naccepted her offer with eagerness, in full confidence of seeing my\\r\\nreputation established, and my wishes fulfilled in a very short time,\\r\\nprovided that I should have the good fortune to please his lordshipâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ntaste. I withdrew the manuscript from the hands of Mr. Brayer, and\\r\\ncommitted it to the care of this gentlewoman, who laboured so\\r\\neffectually in my interest, that in less than a month it was conveyed\\r\\nto the earl, and in a few weeks after, I had the satisfaction to hear\\r\\nthat he had read and approved it very much. Transported with this piece\\r\\nof intelligence, I flattered myself with the hopes of his interesting\\r\\nhimself in its favour, but, hearing no more of this matter in three\\r\\nwhole months, I began (God forgive me!) to suspect the veracity of the\\r\\nperson who brought me the good tidings; for I thought it impossible\\r\\nthat a man of his rank and character, who knew the difficulty of\\r\\nwriting a good tragedy, and understood the dignity of the work, should\\r\\nread and applaud an essay of this kind, without feeling an inclination\\r\\nto befriend the author, whom his countenance alone could raise above\\r\\ndependence. But it was not long before I found my friend very much\\r\\nwronged by my opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must know, that the civilities I had received from Lord Rattle,\\r\\nand the desire he manifested to promote the success of my play,\\r\\nencouraged me to write an account of my bad fortune to his lordship,\\r\\nwho condescended so far as to desire, by letter, a young squire of a\\r\\ngreat estate, with whom he was intimate, to espouse my cause, and, in\\r\\nparticular, make me acquainted with one Mr. Marmozet, a celebrated\\r\\nplayer, who had lately appeared on the stage with astonishing eclat,\\r\\nand bore such sway in the house where he acted, that the managers durst\\r\\nnot refuse anything he recommended. The young gentleman, whom Lord\\r\\nRattle had employed for this purpose, being diffident of his own\\r\\ninterest with Mr. Marmozet, had recourse to a nobleman of his\\r\\nacquaintance, who, at his solicitation, was so good as to introduce me\\r\\nto him; and the conversation turning upon my performance, I was not a\\r\\nlittle surprised, as well as pleased, to hear that Earl Sheerwit had\\r\\nspoken very much in its praise, and even sent Mr. Marmozet the copy,\\r\\nwith a message, expressing a desire that he would act in it next\\r\\nseason. Nor was this favourite actor backward in commending the piece,\\r\\nwhich he mentioned with such expressions of regard, that I do not\\r\\nchoose to repeat: assuring me that he would appear in it, provided he\\r\\nshould be engaged to play at all during the ensuing season. In the\\r\\nmeantime, he desired I would give him leave to peruse it in the\\r\\ncountry, whither he intended to remove next day, that he might have\\r\\nleisure to consider and point out such alterations as might, perhaps,\\r\\nbe necessary for its representation; and took my direction, that he\\r\\nmight communicate by letter the observations he should make. Trusting\\r\\nto these assurances, and the interest which had been made in my behalf,\\r\\nI hugged myself in the expectation of seeing it not only acted, but\\r\\nacted to the greatest advantage, and this I thought could not fail of\\r\\nrecompensing me in ample manner for the anxiety and affliction I had\\r\\nundergone; but six weeks being elapsed, I did not know how to reconcile\\r\\nMr. Marmozetâ\\x80\\x99s silence with his promise of writing to me in ten days\\r\\nafter he set out for the country; however, I was at last favoured with\\r\\na letter, importing that he had made some remarks on my tragedy, which\\r\\nhe would freely impart at meeting, and advised me to put it, without\\r\\nloss of time, into the hands of that manager, who had the best company;\\r\\nas he himself was quite uncertain whether or not he should be engaged\\r\\nthat winter. I was a good deal alarmed at this last part of his letter,\\r\\nand advised about it with a friend, who told me, it was a plain\\r\\nindication of Mr. Marmozetâ\\x80\\x99s desire to get rid of his promise; that his\\r\\npretended uncertainty about acting next winter was no other than a\\r\\nscandalous evasion; for, to his certain knowledge, he was already\\r\\nengaged, or at least in terms, with Mr. Vandal; and that his design was\\r\\nto disappoint me, in favour of a new comedy, which he had purchased of\\r\\nthe author, and intended to bring upon the stage for his own advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn short, my dear sir, this person, who, I must own, is if a sanguine\\r\\ncomplexion, handled the moral character of Mr. Marmozet with such\\r\\nseverity, that I began to suspect him of some particular prejudice, and\\r\\nput myself upon my guard against his insinuations. I ought to crave\\r\\npardon for this tedious narration of trivial circumstances, which,\\r\\nhowever interesting they may be to me, must certainly be very dry and\\r\\ninsipid to the ear of one unconcerned in the affair. But I understand\\r\\nthe meaning of your looks, and will proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, sir, Mr. Marmozet, upon his return to town, treated me with\\r\\nuncommon complaisance, and invited me to his lodgings, where he\\r\\nproposed to communicate his remarks, which, I confess, were more\\r\\nunfavourable than I expected; but I answered his objections, and, as I\\r\\nthought, brought him over to my opinion; for, on the whole, he\\r\\nsignified the highest approbation of the performance. In the course of\\r\\nour dispute, I was not a little surprised to find this poor gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmemory so treacherous, as to let him forget what he had said to me,\\r\\nbefore he went out of town, in regard to Earl Sheerwitâ\\x80\\x99s opinion of my\\r\\nplay, which he now professed himself ignorant of; and I was extremely\\r\\nmortified at hearing from his own mouth, that his interest with Mr.\\r\\nVandal was so very low as to be insufficient of itself to bring a new\\r\\npiece upon the stage. I then begged his advice, and he counselled me to\\r\\napply to Earl Sheerwit, for a message in my favour to the manager, who\\r\\nwould not presume to refuse anything recommended by so great man; and\\r\\nhe was so kind as to promise to second this message with all his power.\\r\\nI had immediate recourse to the worthy gentlewoman my friend, already\\r\\nmentioned, who opened the channels of her conveyance with such\\r\\nexpedition, that in a few days I had a promise of the message, provided\\r\\nI could assure myself of Mr. Vandalâ\\x80\\x99s being unengaged to any other\\r\\nwriter; for his lordship did not choose to condescend so far, until he\\r\\nshould understand that there was a probability (at least) of\\r\\nsucceeding; at the same time that blessed me with this piece of news, I\\r\\nwas startled at another, by the same channel of communication; which\\r\\nwas, that Mr. Marmozet, before he advised me to this application, had\\r\\ninformed the earl that he had read my play, and found it altogether\\r\\nunfit for the stage. Though I could not doubt the certainty of this\\r\\nintelligence, I believed there was some inapprehension in the case;\\r\\nand, without taking any notice of it, told Mr. Marmozet the answer I\\r\\nhad been favoured with; and he promised to ask Mr. Vandal the question\\r\\nproposed. I waited upon him in a day or two, when he gave me to\\r\\nunderstand, that Mr. Vandal having professed himself free of all\\r\\nengagements, he had put my play into his hands, and represented it as a\\r\\npiece strongly recommended by Earl Sheerwit, who (he assured him) would\\r\\nhonour him with a message in its favour; and he desired me to call for\\r\\nan answer at Mr. Vandalâ\\x80\\x99s house in three days. I followed his\\r\\ndirections, and found the manager, who being made acquainted with my\\r\\nbusiness, owned that Mr. Marmozet had given him a manuscript play, but\\r\\ndenied that he had mentioned Earl Sheerwitâ\\x80\\x99s name. When I informed him\\r\\nof the circumstances of the affair, he said, he had no engagement with\\r\\nany author; that he would read my tragedy forthwith; and did not\\r\\nbelieve he should venture to reject it in contradiction to his\\r\\nlordshipâ\\x80\\x99s opinion, for which he had the utmost veneration, but put it\\r\\ninto rehearsal without loss of time. I was so much intoxicated with\\r\\nthis encouragement, that I overlooked the mysterious conduct of Mr.\\r\\nMarmozet, and attended the manager at the time appointed, when, to my\\r\\ninfinite confusion, he pronounced my play improper for the stage, and\\r\\nrejected it accordingly. As soon as I could recollect myself from the\\r\\ndisorder into which this unexpected refusal had thrown me, I expressed\\r\\na desire of hearing his objections, which were so groundless,\\r\\nindistinct, and unintelligible, that I persuaded myself he had not at\\r\\nall perused the piece, but had been prompted by somebody whose lessons\\r\\nhe had not rightly retained. However, I have been since informed that\\r\\nthe poor manâ\\x80\\x99s head, which was not naturally very clear, had been\\r\\ndisordered with superstition, and that he laboured under the tyranny of\\r\\na wife, and the terrors of hellfire at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPrecipitated in this manner from the highest pinnacle of hope to the\\r\\nabyss of despondence, I was ready to sink under the burden of my\\r\\naffliction, and, in the bitterness of my anguish, could not help\\r\\nentertaining some doubts of Mr. Marmozetâ\\x80\\x99s integrity, when I\\r\\nrecollected and compared the circumstances of his conduct towards me. I\\r\\nwas encouraged in this suspicion by being told that my Lord Sheerwit\\r\\nhad spoken of his character with great contempt: and, in particular,\\r\\nresented his insolence in opposing his own taste to that of his\\r\\nlordship, concerning my tragedy. While I hesitated between different\\r\\nopinions of the matter, that friend, who (as I told you before) was a\\r\\nlittle hot-headed, favoured me with a visit, and, having heard a\\r\\ncircumstantial account of the whole affair, could not contain his\\r\\nindignation, but affirmed without ceremony that Mr. Marmozet was the\\r\\nsole occasion of my disappointment; that he acted from first to last\\r\\nwith the most perfidious dissimulation, cajoling me with insinuating\\r\\ncivilities, while he underhand employed all his art and influence to\\r\\nprejudice the ignorant manager against my performance; that nothing\\r\\ncould equal his hypocrisy but his avarice, which engrossed the\\r\\nfaculties of his soul so much, that he scrupled not to be guilty of the\\r\\nmeanest practices to gratify that sordid appetite; that, in consequence\\r\\nof this disposition, he had prostituted his honour in betraying my\\r\\ninexperience, and in undermining the interest of another author of\\r\\nestablished reputation, who had also offered a tragedy to the stage,\\r\\nwhich he thought would interfere with the success of the comedy he had\\r\\nbought, and determined to bring on at all events.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was shocked at the description of such a monster, which I could not\\r\\nbelieve existed in the world, bad as it is, and argued against the\\r\\nasseverations of my friend, by demonstrating the bad policy of such\\r\\nbehaviour, which could not fail of entailing infamy upon the author;\\r\\nand the small temptation that a man of Mr. Marmozetâ\\x80\\x99s figure and\\r\\nsuccess could have to consult his interest in such a grovelling manner,\\r\\nwhich must create contempt and abhorrence of him in his patrons, and\\r\\neffectually deprive him of the countenance and protection he now enjoys\\r\\nin such an eminent degree. He pretended to laugh at my simplicity, and\\r\\nasked, if I knew for which of his virtues he was so much caressed by\\r\\nthe people of fashion. â\\x80\\x9cIt is not,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cfor the qualities of his\\r\\nheart, that this little parasite is invited to the tables of dukes and\\r\\nlords, who hire extraordinary cooks for his entertainment. His avarice\\r\\nthey see not, his ingratitude they feel not, his hypocrisy accommodates\\r\\nitself to their humours, and is of consequence pleasing; but he is\\r\\nchiefly courted for his buffoonery, and will be admitted into the\\r\\nchoicest parties of quality for his talent of mimicking Punch and his\\r\\nwife Joan, when a poet of the most excellent genius is not able to\\r\\nattract the least regard.â\\x80\\x9d God forbid, Mr. Random, that I should credit\\r\\nassertions that degrade the dignity of our superiors so much, and\\r\\nrepresent the poor man as the most abject of all beings! No, I looked\\r\\nupon them as the hyperboles of passion; and though that comedy of which\\r\\nhe spoke did actually appear, I dare not doubt the innocence of Mr.\\r\\nMarmozet, who, I am told, is as much as ever in favour with the earl; a\\r\\ncircumstance that, surely, could not be, unless he had vindicated his\\r\\ncharacter to the satisfaction of his lordship. Pray forgive this long\\r\\ndigression, and give me the hearing a little longer; for, thank heaven!\\r\\nI am now near the goal.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBaffled in all my attempts, I despaired of seeing my play acted; and\\r\\nbethought myself of choosing some employment that might afford a sure,\\r\\nthough mean subsistence; but my landlord, to whom I was by this time\\r\\nconsiderably indebted, and who had laid his account with having his\\r\\nmoney paid all in a heap from the profits of my third night, could not\\r\\nbrook his disappointment, therefore made another effort in my behalf,\\r\\nand, by dint of interest, procured a message from a lady of fashion to\\r\\nMr. Brayer, who had always professed a great veneration for her,\\r\\ndesiring that he would set up my play forthwith, and assuring him that\\r\\nshe and all her friends would support it in the performance. To\\r\\nstrengthen my interest, she engaged his best actors in my cause; and,\\r\\nin short, exerted herself so much, that it was again received, and my\\r\\nhopes began to revive. But Mr. Brayer, honest man, was so much\\r\\nengrossed by business of vast consequence, though to appearance he had\\r\\nnothing at all to do, that he could not find time to read it until the\\r\\nseason was pretty far advanced; and read it he must, for\\r\\nnotwithstanding his having perused it before, his memory did not retain\\r\\none circumstance of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt length he favoured it with his attention, and having proposed\\r\\ncertain alterations, sent his duty to the lady who patronised it, and\\r\\npromised, on his honour, to bring it on next winter, provided these\\r\\nalterations should be made, and the copy delivered to him before the\\r\\nend of April. With an aching heart, I submitted to these conditions,\\r\\nand performed them accordingly: but fortune owed me another unforeseen\\r\\nmortification; Mr. Marmozet, during the summer, became joint patentee\\r\\nwith Mr. Brayer, so that when I claimed performance of articles, I was\\r\\ntold he could do nothing without the consent of his partner, who was\\r\\npre-engaged to another author.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy condition was rendered desperate by the death of my good friend and\\r\\nlandlord, whose executors obtained a judgment against my effects, which\\r\\nthey seized, turned me out into the streets naked, friendless, and\\r\\nforlorn: there I was arrested at the suit of my tailor, and thrown into\\r\\nthe prison, where I have made shift to live these five weeks on the\\r\\nbounty of my fellow prisoners, who, I hope, are not the worse for the\\r\\ninstruction and good offices by which I manifest my gratitude; but in\\r\\nspite of all their charitable endeavours, my life was scarce tolerable,\\r\\nuntil your uncommon benevolence enabled me to enjoy it with comfort.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LXIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI am seized with a deep Melancholy, and become a Slovenâ\\x80\\x94am relieved by\\r\\nmy Uncleâ\\x80\\x94he prevails upon me to engage with his Owners, as a Surgeon of\\r\\nthe Ship which he commandsâ\\x80\\x94he makes me a considerable Presentâ\\x80\\x94entertain\\r\\nStrap as his stewardâ\\x80\\x94I take leave of my Friends, and go on Boardâ\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nShip arrives in the Downs\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall not make any reflection on this story, in the course of which\\r\\nthe reader must perceive how egregiously the simplicity and milky\\r\\ndisposition of this worthy man had been duped and abused by a set of\\r\\nscoundrels, who were so habituated to falsehood and equivocation, that\\r\\nI verily believed they would have found the utmost difficulty in\\r\\nuttering one syllable of truth, though their lives had depended upon\\r\\ntheir sincerity. Notwithstanding all I had suffered from the knavery\\r\\nand selfishness of mankind, I was amazed and incensed by the base\\r\\nindifference which suffered such uncommon merit as he possessed to\\r\\nlanguish in obscurity, and struggle with all the miseries of a\\r\\nloathsome gaol; and should have blessed the occasion that secluded me\\r\\nfrom such a perfidious world, had not the remembrance of my amiable\\r\\nNarcissa preserved my attachment to a society of which she constituted\\r\\na part. The picture of that lovely creature was the constant companion\\r\\nof my solitude. How often did I contemplate the resemblance of those\\r\\nenchanting features that first captivated my heart! how often did I\\r\\nweep over those endearing scenes which her image recalled! and how\\r\\noften did I curse my perfidious fate for having robbed me of the fair\\r\\noriginal! In vain did my imagination flatter me with schemes of future\\r\\nhappiness: surly reason always interposed, and in a moment overthrew\\r\\nthe unsubstantial fabric, by chastising the extravagance of my hope,\\r\\nand representing my unhappy situation in the right point of view. In\\r\\nvain did I fly for refuge to the amusements of the place, and engage in\\r\\nthe parties of Jackson at cards, billiards, nine-pins, and fives; a\\r\\ntrain of melancholy thoughts took possession of my soul, which even the\\r\\nconversation of Melopoyn could not divert. I ordered Strap to inquire\\r\\nevery day at Banterâ\\x80\\x99s lodgings, in expectation of hearing again from my\\r\\ncharmer; and my disappointment considerably, augmented my chagrin. My\\r\\naffectionate valet was infected with my sorrow, and often sat with me\\r\\nwhole hours without speaking, uttering sigh for sigh, and shedding tear\\r\\nfor tear. This fellowship increased our distemper; he became incapable\\r\\nof business, and was discarded by his master; while I, seeing my money\\r\\nmelt away without any certainty of deliverance, and, in short, all my\\r\\nhopes frustrated, grew negligent of life, lost all appetite, and\\r\\ndegenerated into such a sloven that during the space of three months I\\r\\nwas neither washed, shifted, nor shaved; so that my face, rendered\\r\\nmeagre with abstinence, was obscured with dirt, and overshadowed with\\r\\nhair, and my whole appearance squalid and even frightful; when, one\\r\\nday, Strap brought me notice, that there was a man below who wanted to\\r\\nspeak with me. Roused at this intelligence, and in full hopes of\\r\\nreceiving a letter from the dear object of my love, I ran downstairs\\r\\nwith the utmost precipitation. And found to my infinite surprise my\\r\\ngenerous uncle, Mr. Bowling! Transported at the sight, I sprang forward\\r\\nto embrace him. Upon which he started aside with great agility, drew\\r\\nhis hanger, and put himself upon his guard, crying, â\\x80\\x9cAvast, brother,\\r\\navast! Sheer off. Yo ho! you turnkey, why donâ\\x80\\x99t you keep a better look\\r\\nout? Hereâ\\x80\\x99s one of your crazy prisoners broke from his lashings, I\\r\\nsuppose.â\\x80\\x9d I could not help laughing heartily at his mistake; but this I\\r\\nsoon rectified by my voice, which he instantly recollected, and shook\\r\\nme by the hand with great affection, testifying his concern at seeing\\r\\nme in such a miserable condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nI conducted him to my apartment, where, in presence of Strap, whom I\\r\\nintroduced to him as one of my best friends, he gave me to understand,\\r\\nthat he was just arrived from the Coast Of Guinea, after having made a\\r\\npretty successful voyage, in which he had acted as mate, until the ship\\r\\nwas attacked by a French privateer, that the captain being killed\\r\\nduring the engagement, he had taken the command, and was so fortunate\\r\\nas to sink the enemy; after which exploit he fell in with a merchant\\r\\nship from Martinico, laden with sugar, indigo and some silver and by\\r\\nvirtue of his letter of marque, attacked, took, and carried her safe\\r\\ninto Kinsale in Ireland, where she was condemned as a lawful prize; by\\r\\nwhich means he had not only got a pretty sum of money, but also\\r\\nacquired the favour of his owners, who had already conferred upon him\\r\\nthe command of a large ship, mounted with twenty nine-pounders, ready\\r\\nto sail upon a very advantageous voyage, which he was not at liberty to\\r\\ndiscover. And he assured me that it was with the greatest difficulty he\\r\\nfound me, in consequence of a direction left for him at his lodgings at\\r\\nWapping.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was rejoiced beyond measure at this account of his good fortune; and,\\r\\nat his desire, recounted all the adventures that had happened to me\\r\\nsince we parted. When he understood the particulars of Strapâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nattachment to me, he squeezed his hand very cordially, and promised to\\r\\nmake a man of him; then, giving me ten guineas for my present occasion,\\r\\ntook a direction for the tailor who arrested me, and went away in order\\r\\nto discharge the debt, telling me at parting, that he would soon fetch\\r\\nup all my leeway with a wet sail.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was utterly confounded at this sudden transition, which affected me\\r\\nmore than any reverse I had formerly felt; and a crowd of incoherent\\r\\nideas rushed so impetuously upon my imagination, that my reason could\\r\\nneither separate nor connect them; when Strap, whose joy had manifested\\r\\nitself in a thousand fool-cries, came into my room with his shaving\\r\\nutensils, and without any previous intimation, began to lather my\\r\\nbeard, whistling with great emotion all the while. I started from my\\r\\nreverie, and, being too well acquainted with Strap to trust myself in\\r\\nhis hands while he was under such agitation, desired to be excused,\\r\\nsent for another barber, and suffered myself to be trimmed. Having\\r\\nperformed the ceremony of ablution, I shifted, and dressing in my\\r\\ngayest apparel, waited for the return of my uncle, who was agreeably\\r\\nsurprised at my sudden transformation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis beneficent kinsman had satisfied my creditor, and obtained an\\r\\norder for my discharge, so that I was no longer a prisoner; but, as I\\r\\nhad some reluctance to part with my friends and fellows in distress, I\\r\\nprevailed upon Mr. Bowling to favour us with his company, and invited\\r\\nMr. Melopoyn and Jackson to spend the evening at my apartment, where I\\r\\nregaled them with a supper, good wine, and the news of my release, on\\r\\nwhich they heartily congratulated me, notwithstanding the loss of my\\r\\ncompany, which, they were pleased to say, they should severely feel. As\\r\\nfor Jackson, his misfortune made so little impression on himself, and\\r\\nhe was altogether so loose, indifferent, and indiscreet, that I could\\r\\nscarce pity his situation: but I had conceived a veneration and\\r\\nfriendship for the poet, who was, in all respects, an object much more\\r\\nworthy of compassion and regard. When our guests withdrew, and my uncle\\r\\nhad retired, with an intention of visiting me next morning, I made up a\\r\\nbundle of some linen and other necessaries; and, bidding Strap carry\\r\\nthem to Mr. Melopoynâ\\x80\\x99s lodgings, went thither myself, and pressed it\\r\\nupon his acceptance, with five guineas, which, with much difficulty, he\\r\\nreceived, assuring me at the same time, that he should never have it in\\r\\nhis power to make satisfaction. I then asked if I could serve him in\\r\\nany other way; to which he answered, â\\x80\\x9cYou have already done too much;â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nand, unable to contain the emotions of his soul any longer, burst into\\r\\ntears, and wept aloud. Moved at this spectacle, I left him to his\\r\\nrepose, and, when my uncle returned in the morning, represented his\\r\\ncharacter in such a favourable light, that the honest seaman was\\r\\naffected with his distress, and determined to follow my example, in\\r\\npresenting him with five pieces more; upon which, that I might save him\\r\\nsome confusion, I advised Mr. Bowling to inclose it in a letter to be\\r\\ndelivered by Strap, after we should be gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was accordingly done. I took a formal leave of all my acquaintance\\r\\nin the gaol; and, just as I was about to step into a hackney coach at\\r\\nthe gate, Jackson calling me, I returned, and he asked me in a whisper,\\r\\nif I could lend him a shilling! His demand being so moderate, and in\\r\\nall likelihood the last he would make upon me, I slipped a guinea into\\r\\nhis hand, which he no sooner perceived, than he cried, â\\x80\\x9cO Jesus, a\\r\\nguinea!â\\x80\\x9d then laying hold of a button of my coat, broke out into\\r\\nlaughter; and when his immoderate fit of convulsion was ended, told me\\r\\nI was an honest fellow, and let me go. The coachman was ordered to\\r\\ndrive to Mr. Bowlingâ\\x80\\x99s lodgings, where, when we arrived, he entered\\r\\ninto a serious discourse with me, on the subject of my situation, and\\r\\nproposed that I should sail with him in quality of his surgeon; in\\r\\nwhich case he would put me in a method of getting a fortune in a few\\r\\nyears by my own industry; and assured me, that I might expect to\\r\\ninherit all that he should die possessed of, provided I should survive\\r\\nhim. Though I was penetrated with a sense of his generosity, l was\\r\\nstartled at a proposal that offered violence to my love, and signified\\r\\nmy sentiments on that head, which he did not seem to relish; but\\r\\nobserved that love was the fruit of idleness, that when once I should\\r\\nbe employed in business, and my mind engaged in making money, I should\\r\\nbe no more troubled with these silly notions, which none but your\\r\\nfair-weathered Jacks, who have nothing but their pleasure to mind,\\r\\nought to entertain. I was piqued at this insinuation, which I looked\\r\\nupon as a reproach, and, without giving myself time to deliberate,\\r\\naccepted his offer. He was overjoyed at my compliance, carried me\\r\\nimmediately to his chief owner, with whom a bargain was struck; so that\\r\\nthen I could not retract with honour, had I been ever so much averse to\\r\\nthe agreement. That I might not have time to cool, he bade me draw out\\r\\na list of medicines for a complement of five hundred men, adapted to\\r\\nthe distempers of hot climates and sufficient for a voyage of eighteen\\r\\nmonths; and carry it to a certain wholesale apothecary, who would also\\r\\nprovide me in two well-qualified mates. While I was thus employed Strap\\r\\ncame in, and looked very blank, when he understood my resolution:\\r\\nhowever, after a pause of some minutes, he insisted upon going along\\r\\nwith me; and at my desire was made shipâ\\x80\\x99s steward by Captain Bowling,\\r\\nwho promised to be at the expense of fitting him out, and to lend him\\r\\ntwo hundred pounds to purchase an adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had delivered my list of medicines, chosen a couple of my own\\r\\ncountrymen for mates, and bespoke a set of chirurgical instruments, my\\r\\nuncle told me, that by his last voyage he had cleared almost three\\r\\nthousand pounds, one-third of which he would immediately make over and\\r\\nput into my hands; that he would procure for me credit to the value of\\r\\nso much more in such goods as would turn to best account in the country\\r\\nto which we were bound; and that, although he looked upon my interest\\r\\nas his own, he would keep the remaining part of his fortune in his own\\r\\ndisposal, with a view of preserving his independence, and the power of\\r\\npunishing me, in case I should not make a good use of what he had\\r\\nalready bestowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout troubling the reader with an account of the effect which this\\r\\nsurprising generosity had upon my mind, I shall only say, that his\\r\\npromises were instantly performed, and an invoice of merchandise proper\\r\\nfor the voyage presented to me, that I might purchase the goods, and\\r\\nship them with all expedition. In the midst of this hurry, the\\r\\nremembrance of my charming Narcissa often interposed, and made me the\\r\\nmost miserable of all mortals. I was distracted with the thought of\\r\\nbeing torn from her, perhaps for ever; and though the hope of seeing\\r\\nher again might have supported me under the torments of separation, I\\r\\ncould not reflect upon the anguish she must feel at parting with me,\\r\\nand the incessant sorrows to which her tender bosom would be exposed\\r\\nduring my absence, without being pierced with the deepest affliction!\\r\\nAs my imagination was daily and nightly upon the rack to invent some\\r\\nmethod of mitigating this cruel stroke, or at least of acquitting my\\r\\nlove and honour in the opinion of this gentle creature, I at length\\r\\nstumbled upon an expedient, with which the reader will be made\\r\\nacquainted in due time; and, in consequence of my determination, became\\r\\nless uneasy and disturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy business being finished, and the ship ready to sail, I resolved to\\r\\nmake my last appearance among my acquaintance at the other end of the\\r\\ntown, where I had not been since my imprisonment; and as I had, by the\\r\\nadvice of my uncle, taken off some very rich clothes for sale, I put on\\r\\nthe gayest suit in my possession, and went in a chair to the\\r\\ncoffee-house I used to frequent, where I found my friend Banter so\\r\\nconfounded at the magnificence of my dress, that, when I made up to\\r\\nhim, he gazed at me with a look of astonishment, without being able,\\r\\nfor some minutes, to open his lips; then pulling me aside by the\\r\\nsleeve, and fixing his eyes on mine, accosted me thus: â\\x80\\x9cRandom, where\\r\\nthe devil have you been! eh? What is the meaning of all this finery?\\r\\nOho! I understand you. You are just arrived from the country! what, the\\r\\nroads are good, eh? Well, Random, you are a bold fellow, and a lucky\\r\\nfellow! but take care, the pitcher goes often to the well, but is broke\\r\\nat last.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he pointed to his collar; by which gesture, and\\r\\nthe broken hints he had ejaculated, I found he suspected me of having\\r\\nrobbed on the highway; and I laughed very heartily at his supposition.\\r\\nWithout explaining myself any further, I told him he was mistaken in\\r\\nhis conjecture; that I had been for some time past with the relation of\\r\\nwhom he had frequently heard me speak; and that, as I should set out\\r\\nnext day upon my travels, I had come to take my leave of my friends,\\r\\nand to receive of him the money he had borrowed from me, which, now\\r\\nthat I was going abroad, I should certainly have occasion for. He was a\\r\\nlittle disconcerted at this demand; but, recollecting himself in a\\r\\nmoment, swore in an affected passion, that I had used him extremely\\r\\nill, and he would never forgive me for having, by this short warning,\\r\\nput it out of his power to free himself of an obligation he could no\\r\\nlonger bear. I could not help smiling at this pretended delicacy, which\\r\\nI commended highly, telling him he needed not to be uneasy on that\\r\\nscore, for I would give him a direction to a merchant in the city, with\\r\\nwhom I would leave a discharge on the sum, to be delivered upon\\r\\npayment. He professed much joy at this expedient, and with great\\r\\neagerness asked the personâ\\x80\\x99s name and place of abode, which he\\r\\nforthwith wrote in his pocket-book, assuring me, that he should not be\\r\\nlong in my debt. This affair, which I knew he should never after think\\r\\nof, being settled to his satisfaction, I sent cards to all my friends,\\r\\ndesiring the favour of their company at a tavern in the evening, when\\r\\nthey honoured my invitation, and I had the pleasure of treating them in\\r\\na very elegant manner, at which they expressed equal admiration as\\r\\napplause. Having enjoyed ourselves till midnight, I took my leave of\\r\\nthem, and was well nigh stifled with caresses: next day, I set out with\\r\\nStrap in a postchaise for Gravesend, where we went on board; and the\\r\\nwind serving, weighed anchor in less than twelve hours. Without meeting\\r\\nwith any accident, we reached the Downs, where we were obliged to come\\r\\nto an anchor, and wait for an easterly wind to carry us out of the\\r\\nChannel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LXV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI set out for Sussexâ\\x80\\x94consult Mrs. Sagelyâ\\x80\\x94achieve an Interview with\\r\\nNarcissaâ\\x80\\x94return to the Shipâ\\x80\\x94we get clear of the Channelâ\\x80\\x94I learn our\\r\\nDestinationâ\\x80\\x94we are chased by a large Shipâ\\x80\\x94the company are dismayed, and\\r\\nencouraged by the Captainâ\\x80\\x99s speechâ\\x80\\x94our pursuer happens to be an English\\r\\nMan of Warâ\\x80\\x94we arrive at the Coast of Guinea, purchase four hundred\\r\\nNegroesâ\\x80\\x94sail for Paraguay, get safe into the River of Plate, and sell\\r\\nour Cargo to great Advantage\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now I put in execution the scheme I had projected at London; and\\r\\nasking leave of the captain for Strap and me to stay on shore till the\\r\\nwind should become favourable, my request was granted, because he had\\r\\norders to remain in the Downs until he should receive some dispatches\\r\\nfrom London, which he did not expect in less than a week. Having\\r\\nimparted my resolution to my trusty valet, who (though he endeavoured\\r\\nto dissuade me from such a rash undertaking) would not quit me in the\\r\\nenterprise, I hired horses, and set out immediately for that part of\\r\\nSussex where my charmer was confined, which was not above thirty miles\\r\\ndistant from Deal, where we mounted. As I was perfectly well acquainted\\r\\nwith the extent of the squireâ\\x80\\x99s estate and influence, I halted within\\r\\nfive miles of his house, where we remained till the twilight, at which\\r\\ntime we set forward, and, by the favour of a dark night, reached a\\r\\ncopse about half-a-mile from the village where Mrs. Sagely lived. Here\\r\\nwe left our horses tied to a tree, and went directly to the house of my\\r\\nold benefactress, Strap trembling all the way, and venting ejaculatory\\r\\npetitions to heaven for our safety. Her habitation being quite\\r\\nsolitary, we arrived at the door without being observed, when I ordered\\r\\nmy companion to enter by himself; and, in case there should be company\\r\\nwith her, deliver a letter which I had writ for that purpose, and say\\r\\nthat a friend of hers in London, understanding that he intended to\\r\\ntravel this road, had committed it to his care. He rapped at the door,\\r\\nto which the good old matron coming, told him that, being a lone woman,\\r\\nhe must excuse her, if she did not open it, until he had declared his\\r\\nname and business. He answered, that his name was unknown to her, and\\r\\nthat his business was to deliver a letter, which (to free her from all\\r\\napprehension) he would convey to her through the space between the door\\r\\nand threshold. This he instantly performed: and she no sooner read the\\r\\ncontents, which specified my being present, than she cried, â\\x80\\x9cIf the\\r\\nperson who wrote this letter be at hand, let him speak, that I may be\\r\\nassured by his voice whether or not I may safely admit him.â\\x80\\x9d I\\r\\nforthwith applied my mouth to the keyhole, and pronounced, â\\x80\\x9cDear\\r\\nmother, you need not be afraid, it is I, so much indebted to your\\r\\ngoodness, who now crave admittance.â\\x80\\x9d She knew my voice, and opening the\\r\\ndoor immediately, received me with a truly maternal affection,\\r\\nmanifesting, by the tears she let fall, her concern lest I should be\\r\\ndiscovered, for she had been informed of everything that had happened\\r\\nbetween Narcissa and me from the dear captiveâ\\x80\\x99s own mouth. When I\\r\\nexplained the motive of my journey, which was no other than a desire of\\r\\nseeing the object of my love before I should quit the kingdom, that I\\r\\nmight in person convince her of the necessity I was under to leave her,\\r\\nreconcile her to that event, by describing the advantages that in all\\r\\nprobability would attend it, repeat my vows of eternal constancy, and\\r\\nenjoy the melancholy pleasure of a tender embrace at parting. I say,\\r\\nwhen I had thus signified my intention, Mrs. Sagely told me, that\\r\\nNarcissa, upon her return from Bath, had been so strictly watched that\\r\\nnobody but one or two of the servants devoted to her brother, was\\r\\nadmitted to her presence, that afterwards she had been a little\\r\\nenlarged, and was permitted to see company; during which indulgence,\\r\\nshe had been several times at the cottage; but of late she had been\\r\\nbetrayed by one of the servants, who discovered to the squire, that he\\r\\nhad once carried a letter from her to the post-house directed to me;\\r\\nupon which information she was now more confined than ever, and that I\\r\\ncould have no chance of seeing her, unless I would run the risk of\\r\\ngetting into the garden, where she and her maid were every day allowed\\r\\nto take the air, and lie hid until I should have an opportunity of\\r\\nspeaking to themâ\\x80\\x94an adventure attended with such danger, that no man in\\r\\nhis right wits would attempt it. This enterprise, hazardous as it was,\\r\\nI resolved to perform, in spite of all the arguments of Mrs. Sagely,\\r\\nwho reasoned, chid, and entreated by turns; and the tears and prayers\\r\\nof Strap, who conjured me on his knees, to have more regard to myself\\r\\nas well as to him, than to attempt my own destruction in such a\\r\\nprecipitate manner. I was deaf to but the suggestions of my love; and\\r\\nordering him to return immediately with the horses to the inn from\\r\\nwhence we set out, and wait for my coming in that place, he at first\\r\\nperemptorily refused to leave me, until I persuaded him, that if our\\r\\nhorses should remain where they were till daylight, they would\\r\\ncertainly be discovered, and the whole country alarmed. On this\\r\\nconsideration, he took his leave in a sorrowful plight, kissed my hand,\\r\\nand, weeping, cried â\\x80\\x9cGod knows if ever I shall see you again.â\\x80\\x9d My kind\\r\\nlandlady, finding me obstinate, gave me her best advice how to behave\\r\\nin the execution of my project: and after having persuaded me to take a\\r\\nlittle refreshment, accommodated me with a bed, and left me to my\\r\\nrepose. Early in the morning I arose, and armed with a couple of loaded\\r\\npistols and a hanger, went to the back part of the squireâ\\x80\\x99s garden,\\r\\nclimbed over the wall, and, according to Mrs. Sagelyâ\\x80\\x99s direction,\\r\\nconcealed myself in a thicket, hard by an alcove that terminated a walk\\r\\nat a good distance from the house, which (I was told) my mistress\\r\\nmostly frequented. Here I absconded from five oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning to\\r\\nsix in the evening, without seeing a human creature; at last I\\r\\nperceived two women approaching, whom, by my throbbing heart, I soon\\r\\nrecognised to be the adorable Narcissa and Miss Williams. I felt the\\r\\nstrongest agitation of soul at the sight; and guessing, that they would\\r\\nrepose themselves in the alcove, stopped into it unperceived, and hid\\r\\nupon the stone table a picture of myself in miniature, for which I had\\r\\nsat in London, purposing to leave it with Narcissa before I should go\\r\\nabroad. I exposed it in this manner, as an introduction to my own\\r\\nappearance, which, without some previous intimation, I was afraid might\\r\\nhave an unlucky effect upon the delicate nerves of my fair enslaver;\\r\\nand then withdrew into the thicket, where I could hear their discourse,\\r\\nand suit myself to the circumstance of the occasion. As they advanced,\\r\\nI observed an air of melancholy in the countenance of Narcissa, blended\\r\\nwith such unspeakable sweetness, that I could scarce refrain from\\r\\nflying into her arms, and kissing away the pearly drop that stood\\r\\ncollected in each bewitching eye. According to my expectation, she\\r\\nentered the alcove, and perceiving something on the table, took it up.\\r\\nNo sooner did she cast her eye upon the features, than, startled at the\\r\\nresemblance, she cried, â\\x80\\x9cGood God!â\\x80\\x9d and the roses instantly vanished\\r\\nfrom her cheeks. Her confidante, alarmed at this exclamation, looked at\\r\\nthe picture; and, struck with the likeness, exclaimed, â\\x80\\x9cJesus! the very\\r\\nfeatures of Mr. Random!â\\x80\\x9d Narcissa, having recollected herself a little,\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x9cWhatever angel brought it hither as a comfort to me in my\\r\\naffliction, I am thankful for the benefit, and will preserve it as the\\r\\ndearest object of my care.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, she kissed it with surprising\\r\\nardour, shed a flood of tears, and then deposited the lifeless image in\\r\\nher lovely bosom. Transported at these symptoms of her unaltered\\r\\naffection, I was about to throw myself at her feet, when Miss Williams,\\r\\nwhose reflection was less engaged than that of her mistress, observed\\r\\nthat the picture could not transport itself hither, and that she could\\r\\nnot help thinking I was not far off. The gentle Narcissa, starting at\\r\\nthis conjecture, answered, â\\x80\\x9cHeaven forbid! for although nothing in the\\r\\nuniverse could yield me satisfaction equal to that of his presence for\\r\\none poor moment, in a proper place, I would rather forfeit his\\r\\ncompanyâ\\x80\\x94almost for ever, than see him here, where his life would be\\r\\nexposed to so much danger.â\\x80\\x9d I could no longer restrain the impulse of\\r\\nmy passion, but, breaking from my concealment, stood before her, when\\r\\nshe uttered a fearful shriek, and fainted in the arms of her companion.\\r\\nI flew towards the treasure of my soul, clasped her in my embrace, and\\r\\nwith the warmth of my kisses, brought her again to life. Oh that I were\\r\\nendowed with the expression of a Raphael, the graces of a Guido, the\\r\\nmagic touches of a Titian, that I might represent the fond concern, the\\r\\nchastened rapture and ingenuous blush, that mingled on her beauteous\\r\\nface, when she opened her eyes upon me, and pronounced, â\\x80\\x9cO heavens! is\\r\\nit you?â\\x80\\x9d I am afraid I have already encroached upon the readerâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npatience with the particulars of this amour, of which (I own) I cannot\\r\\nhelp being impertinently circumstantial. I shall therefore omit the\\r\\nless material passages of this interview, during which I convinced her\\r\\nreason, though I could not appease the sad presages of her love, with\\r\\nregard to the long voyage and dangers I must undergo. When we had spent\\r\\nan hour (which was all she could spare from the barbarity of her\\r\\nbrotherâ\\x80\\x99s vigilance) in lamenting over our hard fate, and in repeating\\r\\nour reciprocal vows, Miss Williams reminded us of the necessity there\\r\\nwas for our immediate parting; and, sure, lovers never parted with such\\r\\nsorrow and reluctance as we. But because my words are incapable of\\r\\ndoing justice to this affecting circumstance, I am obliged to draw a\\r\\nveil over it, and observe, that I returned in the dark to the house of\\r\\nMrs. Sagely, who was overjoyed to hear of my success, and opposed the\\r\\ntumults of my grief with such strength of reason, that my mind\\r\\nregained, in some measure, its tranquillity; and that very night, after\\r\\nhaving forced upon the good gentlewoman a purse of twenty guineas, as a\\r\\ntoken of my gratitude and esteem, I took my leave of her, and set out\\r\\non foot for the inn, where my arrival freed honest Strap from the\\r\\nhorrors of unutterable dread.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe took horse immediately, and alighted early next morning at Deal,\\r\\nwhere I found my uncle in great concern on account of my absence,\\r\\nbecause he had received his despatches, and must have weighed with the\\r\\nfirst fair wind, whether I had been on board or not. Next day, a brisk\\r\\neasterly gale springing up, we set sail, and in eight and forty hours\\r\\ngot clear of the Channel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we were about two hundred leagues to westward of the Landâ\\x80\\x99s End,\\r\\nthe captain, taking me apart into the cabin, told me that, now he was\\r\\npermitted by his instructions, he would disclose the intent and\\r\\ndestination of our voyage. â\\x80\\x9cThe ship,â\\x80\\x9d said he, â\\x80\\x9cwhich has been fitted\\r\\nout at a great expense, is bound for the coast of Guinea, where we\\r\\nshall exchange part of our cargo for slaves and gold dust, from whence\\r\\nwe will transport our negroes to Buenos Ayres in New Spain, where (by\\r\\nvirtue of passports, obtained from our own court, and that of Madrid)\\r\\nwe will dispose of them and the goods that remain on board for silver,\\r\\nby means of our supercargo, who is perfectly well acquainted with the\\r\\ncoast, the lingo, and inhabitants.â\\x80\\x9d Being thus let into the secret of\\r\\nour expedition, I borrowed of the supercargo a Spanish grammar,\\r\\ndictionary, and some other books of the same language, which I studied\\r\\nwith such application that, before we arrived in New Spain, I could\\r\\nmaintain a conversation with him in that tongue. Being arrived in the\\r\\nwarm latitudes, I ordered (with the captainâ\\x80\\x99s consent) the whole shipâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncompany to be blooded and purged, myself undergoing the same\\r\\nevacuation, in order to prevent those dangerous fevers to which\\r\\nnorthern constitutions are subject in hot climates; and I have reason\\r\\nto believe, that this precaution was not unserviceable, for we lost but\\r\\none sailor during our whole passage to the coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, when we had been about five weeks at sea, we descried to\\r\\nwindward a large ship bearing down upon us with all the sail she could\\r\\ncarry. Upon which, my uncle ordered the studding-sails to be hoisted\\r\\nand the ship to be cleared for engaging; but, finding that (to use the\\r\\nseamanâ\\x80\\x99s phrase) we were very much wronged by the ship which had us in\\r\\nchase, and by this time had hoisted French colours, he commanded the\\r\\nstudding-sails to be taken in, the courses to be clowed up, the main\\r\\ntopsail to be backed, the tompions to be taken out of the guns, and\\r\\nevery man to repair to his quarters. While every body was busied in the\\r\\nperformance of these orders, Strap came upon the quarter-deck,\\r\\ntrembling and looking aghast, and, with a voice half-suppressed by\\r\\nfear, asked if I thought we were a match for the vessel in pursuit of\\r\\nus. Observing his consternation, I said, â\\x80\\x9cWhat! are you afraid, Strap.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAfraid! (he replied); n-n-no; what should I be afraid of? I thank God\\r\\nI have a clear conscience; but I believe it will be a bloody battle,\\r\\nand I wish you may not have occasion for another hand to assist you in\\r\\nthe cockpit.â\\x80\\x9d I immediately perceived his drift, and making the captain\\r\\nacquainted with his situation, desired he might be stationed below with\\r\\nme and my mates. My uncle, incensed at his pusillanimity, bade me send\\r\\nhim down instantly, that his fear might not infect the shipâ\\x80\\x99s company;\\r\\nwhereupon I told the poor steward that I had begged him for my\\r\\nassistant, and desired him to go down and help my mates to get ready\\r\\nthe instruments and dressings. Notwithstanding the satisfaction he must\\r\\nhave felt at those tidings, he affected a shyness of quitting the upper\\r\\ndeck; and said, he hoped I did not imagine he was afraid to do his duty\\r\\nabove board; for he believed himself as well prepared for death as any\\r\\nman in the ship, no disparagement to me or the captain. I was disgusted\\r\\nat this affectation; and, in order to punish his hypocrisy, assured him\\r\\nhe might take his choice, either of going down to the cockpit with me,\\r\\nor staying upon deck during the engagement. Alarmed at this\\r\\nindifference, he replied, â\\x80\\x9cWell, to oblige you, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go down, but\\r\\nremember it is more for your sake than my own.â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he\\r\\ndisappeared in a twinkling, without waiting for an answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time, we could observe two tier of guns in the ship which\\r\\npursued us, and which was now but two short miles astern. This\\r\\ndiscovery had an evident effect upon the sailors, who did not scruple\\r\\nto say, that we should be torn to pieces, and blown out of the water,\\r\\nand that, if in case any of them should lose their precious limbs, they\\r\\nmust go a begging for life, for there was no provision made by the\\r\\nmerchants for those poor souls who are maimed in their service. The\\r\\ncaptain, understanding this, ordered the crew abaft, and spoke to them\\r\\nthus: â\\x80\\x9cMy lads, I am told you hang an aâ\\x80\\x94se. I have gone to sea thirty\\r\\nyears, a man and a boy, and never saw English sailors afraid before.\\r\\nMayhap you may think I want to expose you for the lucre of gain.\\r\\nWhosoever thinks so, thinks a dâ\\x80\\x94ned lie, for my whole cargo is insured;\\r\\nso that, in case I should be taken, my loss would not be great. The\\r\\nenemy is stronger than we, to be sure. What then? have we not a chance\\r\\nfor carrying away one of her masts, and so get clear of her? If we find\\r\\nher too hard for us, â\\x80\\x99tis but striking at last. If any man is hurt in\\r\\nthe engagement, I promise on the word of an honest seaman, to make him\\r\\na recompense according to his loss. So now, you that are lazy,\\r\\nlubberly, cowardly dogs, get away and skulk in the hold and bread-room;\\r\\nand you, that are jolly boys, stand by me, and let us give one\\r\\nbroadside for the honour of Old England.â\\x80\\x9d This eloquent harangue was so\\r\\nwell adapted to the disposition of his hearers, that one and all of\\r\\nthem, pulling off their hats, waved them over their heads, and saluted\\r\\nhim with three cheers; upon which he sent his boy for two large\\r\\ncase-bottles of brandy: having treated every man with a dram, they\\r\\nrepaired to their quarters, and waited impatiently for the word of\\r\\ncommand. I must do my uncle the justice to say, that in the whole of\\r\\nhis disposition, he behaved with the utmost intrepidity, conduct, and\\r\\ndeliberation. The enemy being very near, he ordered me to my station,\\r\\nand was just going to give the word for hoisting the colours, and\\r\\nfiring, when the supposed Frenchman hauled down his white pennant,\\r\\njack, and ensign, hoisted English ones, and fired a gun a-head of us.\\r\\nThis was a joyful event to Captain Bowling, who immediately showed his\\r\\ncolours, and fired a gun to leeward; upon which the other ship ran\\r\\nalongside of us, hailed him, and, giving him to know that she was an\\r\\nEnglish man-of-war of forty guns, ordered him to hoist out his boat and\\r\\ncome on board. This command he obeyed with the more alacrity, because,\\r\\nupon inquiry, he found that she was commanded by an old messmate of\\r\\nhis, who was overjoyed to see him, detained him to dinner, and sent his\\r\\nbarge for the supercargo and me, who were very much caressed on his\\r\\naccount. As this commander was destined to cruise upon the French in\\r\\nthe latitude of Martinico, his stem and quarters were adorned with\\r\\nwhite fleurs-de-lis, and the whole shell of the ship so much disguised\\r\\nfor a decoy to the enemy, that it was no wonder my uncle did not know\\r\\nher, although he had sailed on board of her many years. We kept company\\r\\nwith her four days, during which time the captains were never asunder,\\r\\nand then parted, our course lying different from hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn less than fortnight after our separation, we made the land of\\r\\nGuinea, near the mouth of the River Gambia; and trading along the coast\\r\\nas far to the southward of the Line as Angola and Bengula, in less than\\r\\nsix months disposed of the greatest part of our cargo, and purchased\\r\\nfour hundred negroes, my adventure having been laid out in gold dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur complement being made up, we took our departure from Cape Negroe,\\r\\nand arrived in the Rio de la Plata in six weeks, having met with\\r\\nnothing remarkable in our voyage, except an epidemic fever, not unlike\\r\\nthe jail distemper, which broke out among our slaves and carried off a\\r\\ngood many of the shipâ\\x80\\x99s company; among whom I lost one of my mates, and\\r\\npoor Strap had well nigh given up the ghost. Having produced our\\r\\npassport to the Spanish governor, we were received with great courtesy,\\r\\nsold our slaves in a very few days, and could have put off five times\\r\\nthe number at our own price; though we were obliged to smuggle the rest\\r\\nof our merchandise, consisting of European bale-goods, which however we\\r\\nmade shift to dispose of at a great advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LXVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI am invited to the Villa of a Spanish Don, where we went with an\\r\\nEnglish Gentleman, and make a very interesting discoveryâ\\x80\\x94we leave\\r\\nBuenos Ayres, and arrive at Jamaica\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur ship being freed from the disagreeable lading of negroes, to whom,\\r\\nindeed, I had been a miserable slave since our leaving the coast of\\r\\nGuinea, I began to enjoy myself, and breathe with pleasure the pure air\\r\\nof Paraguay, this part of which is reckoned the Montpelier of South\\r\\nAmerica, and has obtained, on account of its climate, the name of\\r\\nBuenos Ayres. It was in this delicious place that I gave myself\\r\\nentirely up to the thoughts of my dear Narcissa, whose image still kept\\r\\npossession of my breast, and whose charms, enhanced by absence,\\r\\nappeared to my imagination, if possible, more engaging than ever! I\\r\\ncalculated the profits of my voyage, which even exceeded my\\r\\nexpectation; resolved to purchase sinecure upon my arrival in England,\\r\\nand if I should find the squire as averse to me as ever, marry his\\r\\nsister by stealth; and in case our family should increase, rely on the\\r\\ngenerosity of my uncle, who was by this time worth a considerable sum.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I amused myself with these agreeable projects, and the\\r\\ntransporting thoughts of enjoying Narcissa, we were very much caressed\\r\\nby the Spanish gentlemen, who frequently formed parties of pleasure for\\r\\nour entertainment, in which we made excursions a good way into the\\r\\ncountry. Among those who signalised themselves by their civility to us,\\r\\nwas one Don Antonio de Ribera, a very polite young gentleman, with whom\\r\\nI had contracted an intimate friendship, who invited us one day to his\\r\\ncountry house, and, as a further inducement to our compliance, promised\\r\\nto procure for us the company of an English Signor, who had been\\r\\nsettled in those parts many years and acquired the love and esteem of\\r\\nthe whole province by his affability, good sense, and honourable\\r\\nbehaviour.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe accepted his invitation, and set out for his villa, where we had not\\r\\nbeen longer than an hour, when the person arrived in whose favour I had\\r\\nbeen so much prepossessed. He was a tall man, remarkably well shaped,\\r\\nof a fine mien and appearance, commanding respect, and seemed to be\\r\\nturned of forty; the features of his face were saddened with a reserve\\r\\nand gravity, which in other countries would have been thought the\\r\\neffect of melancholy; but here appeared to have been contracted by his\\r\\ncommerce with the Spaniards, who are remarkable for that severity of\\r\\ncountenance. Understanding from Don Antonio that we were his\\r\\ncountrymen, he saluted us all round very complacently, and fixing his\\r\\neyes attentively on me, uttered a deep sigh. I had been struck with a\\r\\nprofound veneration for him at his first coming into the room; and no\\r\\nsooner observed this expression of his sorrow, directed, as it were, in\\r\\na particular manner to me, that my heart took part in his grief; I\\r\\nsympathised involuntarily and sighed in my turn. Having asked leave of\\r\\nour entertainer, he accosted us in English, professed his satisfaction\\r\\nat seeing so many of his countrymen in such a remote place, and asked\\r\\nthe captain, who went by the name of Signor Thoma, from what part of\\r\\nBritain he had sailed and whither he was bound. My uncle told him that\\r\\nwe had sailed from the River Thames, and were bound for the same plane\\r\\nby the way of Jamaica, where we intended to take in a lading of sugar.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving satisfied himself in these and other particulars about the state\\r\\nof the war, he gave us to understand, that he had a longing desire to\\r\\nrevisit his native country, in consequence of which he had already\\r\\ntransmitted to Europe the greatest part of his fortune in neutral\\r\\nbottoms, and would willingly embark the rest of it with himself in our\\r\\nship, provided the captain had no objection to such a passenger. My\\r\\nuncle very prudently replied, that for his part he should be glad of\\r\\nhis company, if he could procure the consent of the governor, without\\r\\nwhich he durst not take him on board, whatever inclination he had to\\r\\noblige him. The gentleman approved of his discretion, and telling him\\r\\nthat there would be no difficulty in obtaining the connivance of the\\r\\ngovernor, who was his good friend, shifted the conversation to another\\r\\nsubject.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was overjoyed to hear his intention, and already interested myself so\\r\\nmuch in his favour that, had he been disappointed, I should have been\\r\\nvery unhappy. In the course of our entertainment, he eyed me with\\r\\nuncommon attachment, I felt a surprising attraction towards him; when\\r\\nhe spoke, I listened with attention and reverence; the dignity of his\\r\\ndeportment filled me with affection and awe; and, in short, the\\r\\nemotions of my soul, in presence of this stranger, were strong and\\r\\nunaccountable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving spent the best part of the day with us, he took his leave,\\r\\ntelling Captain Thoma, that he should hear from him in a short time. He\\r\\nwas no sooner gone than I asked a thousand questions about him of Don\\r\\nAntonio, who could give me no other satisfaction than that his name was\\r\\nDon Rodrigo, that he had lived fifteen or sixteen years in these parts,\\r\\nwas reputed rich, and supposed to have been unfortunate in his younger\\r\\nyears, because he was observed to nourish a pensive melancholy, even\\r\\nfrom the time of his first settlement among them; but that nobody had\\r\\nventured to inquire into the cause of his sorrow, in consideration of\\r\\nhis peace, which might suffer in the recapitulation of his misfortunes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was seized with an irresistible desire of knowing the particulars of\\r\\nhis fate, and enjoyed not an hour of repose during the whole night, by\\r\\nreason of the eager conceptions that inspired me with regard to his\\r\\nstory, which I resolved (if possible) to learn. Next morning, while we\\r\\nwere at breakfast, three mules, richly caparisoned, arrived with a\\r\\nmessage from Don Rodrigo, desiring our company, and that of Don\\r\\nAntonio, at his house, which was situated about ten miles further up in\\r\\nthe country. I was pleased with this invitation, in consequence of\\r\\nwhich we mounted the mules which he had provided for us, and alighted\\r\\nat his house before noon. Here we were splendidly entertained by the\\r\\ngenerous stranger, who still seemed to show a particular regard for me,\\r\\nand after dinner made me a present of a ring, set with a beautiful\\r\\namethyst, the production of that country, saying, at the same time,\\r\\nthat he was once blessed with a son, who, had he lived, would have been\\r\\nnearly of my age. This observation, delivered with a profound sigh,\\r\\nmade my heart throb with violence: a crowd of confused ideas rushed\\r\\nupon my imagination, which, while I endeavoured to unravel, my uncle\\r\\nperceived my absence of thought, and tapping me on the shoulder, said,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOons, are you asleep, Rory?â\\x80\\x9d Before I had time to reply, Don Rodrigo,\\r\\nwith uncommon eagerness of voice and look, pronounced, â\\x80\\x9cPray, captain,\\r\\nwhat is the young gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s name?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHis name,â\\x80\\x9d said my uncle, â\\x80\\x9cis\\r\\nRoderick Random.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cGracious Powers!â\\x80\\x9d cried the stranger, starting\\r\\nupâ\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x9cAnd his motherâ\\x80\\x99s?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHis mother,â\\x80\\x9d answered the captain, amazed, â\\x80\\x9cwas\\r\\ncalled Charlotte Bowling.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cO bounteous Heaven!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Don Rodrigo,\\r\\nspringing across the table, and clasping me in his arms, â\\x80\\x9cmy son! my\\r\\nson! have I found thee again? do I hold thee in my embrace, after\\r\\nhaving lost and despaired of seeing thee so long?â\\x80\\x9d So saying, he fell\\r\\nupon my neck, and wept aloud with joy; while the power of nature\\r\\noperating strongly in my breast. I was lost in rapture, and while he\\r\\npressed me to his heart, let fall a shower of tears in his bosom. His\\r\\nutterance was choked up a good while by the agitation of his soul; at\\r\\nlength he broke out into â\\x80\\x9cMysterious Providence!â\\x80\\x94O my dear Charlotte,\\r\\nthere yet remains a pledge of our love! and such a pledge!â\\x80\\x94so found! O\\r\\ninfinite Goodness, let me adore thy all-wise decrees!â\\x80\\x9d Having thus\\r\\nexpressed himself, he kneeled upon the floor, lifted up his eyes and\\r\\nhands to heaven, and remained some minutes in silent ecstacy of\\r\\ndevotion. I put myself in the same posture, adored the all-good\\r\\nDispenser in a prayer of mental thanksgiving: and when his ejaculation\\r\\nwas ended, did homage to my father, and craved his paternal blessing.\\r\\nHe hugged me again with unutterable fondness, and having implored the\\r\\nprotection of Heaven upon my head, raised me from the ground, and\\r\\npresented me as his son to the company, who wept in concert over this\\r\\naffecting scene. Among the rest, my uncle did not fail to discover the\\r\\ngoodness and joy of his heart. Albeit unused to the melting mood, he\\r\\nblubbered with great tenderness, and wringing my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s hand, cried,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBrother Random, Iâ\\x80\\x99m rejoiced to see youâ\\x80\\x94God be praised for this happy\\r\\nmeeting!â\\x80\\x9d Don Rodrigo, understanding that he was his brother-in-law,\\r\\nembraced him affectionately, saying, â\\x80\\x9cAre you my Charlotteâ\\x80\\x99s brother?\\r\\nAlas! unhappy Charlotte! but why should I repine? we shall meet again,\\r\\nnever more to part! Brother, you are truly welcome. Dear son, I am\\r\\ntransported with unspeakable joy! This day is a jubileeâ\\x80\\x94my friends and\\r\\nservants shall share my satisfaction.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he dispatched messengers to the gentlemen in the neighbourhood,\\r\\nto announce this event, and gave orders for a grand entertainment, I\\r\\nwas so much affected with the tumults of passion, which assailed me on\\r\\nthis great, sudden, and unexpected occasion, that I fell sick, fevered,\\r\\nand in less than three hours became quite delirious: so that the\\r\\npreparations were countermanded, and the joy of the family converted\\r\\ninto grief and despair. Physicians were instantly called, I was\\r\\nplentifully blooded in the foot, my lower extremities were bathed in a\\r\\ndecoction of salutiferous herbs: in ten hours after I was taken ill I\\r\\nenjoyed a critical sweat, and next day felt the remains of the\\r\\ndistemper, but an agreeable lassitude, which did not hinder me from\\r\\ngetting up. During the progress of this fever, which, from the term or\\r\\nits duration, is called ephemera, my father never once quitted my\\r\\nbedside, but administered the prescriptions of the physicians with the\\r\\nmost pious care; while Captain Bowling manifested his concern by the\\r\\nlike attendance. I no sooner found myself delivered from this disease,\\r\\nthan I bethought myself of my honest friend Strap; and resolving to\\r\\nmake him happy forthwith in the knowledge of my good fortune, told my\\r\\nfather in general, that I had been infinitely obliged to this faithful\\r\\nadherent, and begged he would indulge me so far as to send for him,\\r\\nwithout letting him know my happiness, until he could receive an\\r\\naccount of it from my own mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy request was instantly complied with, and a messenger with a spare\\r\\nmule despatched to the ship, carrying orders from the captain to the\\r\\nmate, to send the steward by the bearer. My health being, in the\\r\\nmeantime, re-established, and my mind composed I began to relish this\\r\\nimportant turn of my fortune, in reflecting upon the advantages with\\r\\nwhich it must be attended; and, as the idea of my lovely Narcissa\\r\\nalways joined itself to every scene of happiness I could imagine, I\\r\\nentertained myself now with the prospect of possessing her in that\\r\\ndistinguished sphere to which she was entitled by her birth and\\r\\nqualifications. Having often mentioned her name while I was deprived of\\r\\nmy senses, my father guessed that there was an intimate connection\\r\\nbetween us, and discovering the picture which hung in my bosom by\\r\\nribbon, did not doubt that it was the resemblance of my amiable\\r\\nmistress. In this belief he was confirmed by my uncle, who told him\\r\\nthat it was the picture of a young woman, to whom I was under promise\\r\\nof marriage. Alarmed at this piece of information, Don Rodrigo took the\\r\\nfirst opportunity of questioning me about the particulars of this\\r\\naffair, which when I had candidly recounted, he approved of my passion,\\r\\nand promised to contribute all in his power towards its success. Though\\r\\nI never doubted his generosity, I was transported on this occasion, and\\r\\nthrowing myself at his feet, told him, he had now completed my\\r\\nhappiness, for, without the possession of Narcissa I should be\\r\\nmiserable among all the pleasures of life. He raised me with a smile of\\r\\npaternal fondness; said he knew what it was to be in love; and observed\\r\\nthat, if he had been as tenderly beloved by his father as I was by\\r\\nmine, he should not now perhaps have causeâ\\x80\\x94here he was interrupted by a\\r\\nsigh, the tear rushed into his eye, suppressed the dictates of his\\r\\ngrief, and the time being opportune, desired me to relate the passages\\r\\nof my life, which my uncle had told him were manifold and surprising. I\\r\\nrecounted the most material circumstances of my fortune, to which he\\r\\nlistened with wonder and attention, manifesting from time to time the\\r\\ndifferent emotions which my different situations may be supposed to\\r\\nhave raised in a parentâ\\x80\\x99s breast; and, when my detail was ended,\\r\\nblessed God for the adversity I had undergone, which, he said, enlarged\\r\\nthe understanding, improved the heart, steeled the constitution, and\\r\\nqualified a young man for all the duties and enjoyments of life much\\r\\nbetter than any education which affluence could bestow.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had thus satisfied his curiosity, I discovered an inclination to\\r\\nhear the particulars of his story, which he gratified by beginning with\\r\\nhis marriage, and proceeded to the day of his disappearing, as I have\\r\\nrelated in the first part of my memoirs. â\\x80\\x9cCareless of life,â\\x80\\x9d continued\\r\\nhe, â\\x80\\x9cand unable to live in a place where every object recalled the\\r\\nmemory of my dear Charlotte, whom I had lost through the barbarity of\\r\\nan unnatural parent, I took my leave of you, my child, then an infant,\\r\\nwith a heart full of unutterable woe, but little suspecting that my\\r\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s unkindness would have descended to my innocent orphan; and\\r\\nsetting out alone at midnight for the nearest seaport, early next\\r\\nmorning got on board a ship, bound, as I had heard, for France; and,\\r\\nbargaining with the master for my passage, bade a long adieu to my\\r\\nnative country, and put to sea with the first fair wind. The place of\\r\\nour destination was Granville, but we had the misfortune to run upon a\\r\\nridge of rocks near the Island of Alderney, called the Caskets, where\\r\\nthe sea running high, the ship went to pieces, the boat sunk alongside,\\r\\nand every soul on board perished, except myself, who, by the assistance\\r\\nof a grating got ashore on the coast of Normandy. I went directly to\\r\\nCaen, where I was so lucky as to meet with a count, whom I had formerly\\r\\nknown in my travels; with this gentleman I set out for Paris, where I\\r\\nwas recommended by him and other friends, as tutor to a young nobleman,\\r\\nwhom I accompanied to the court of Spain. There we remained a whole\\r\\nyear, at the end of which my pupil being recalled by his father, I\\r\\nquitted my office, and stayed behind, by the advice of a certain\\r\\nSpanish grandee, who took me into his protection, and introduced me to\\r\\nanother nobleman, who was afterwards created viceroy of Peru. He\\r\\ninsisted on my attending, him to his government of the Indies, where,\\r\\nhowever, by reason of my religion, it was not in his power to make my\\r\\nfortune any other way than by encouraging me to trade, which I had not\\r\\nlong prosecuted when my patron died, and I found myself in the midst of\\r\\nstrangers, without one friend to support or protect me. Urged by this\\r\\nconsideration, I sold my effects, and removed to this country, the\\r\\ngovernor of which, having been appointed by the viceroy, was my\\r\\nintimate acquaintance. Here has heaven prospered my endeavours, during\\r\\na residence of sixteen years, in which my tranquillity was never\\r\\ninvaded but by the remembrance of your mother, whose death I have in\\r\\nsecret mourned without ceasing, and the reflection of you, whose fate I\\r\\ncould never learn notwithstanding all my inquiries by means of my\\r\\nfriends in France, who, after the most strict examination, could give\\r\\nme no other account than that you went abroad six years ago, and was\\r\\nnever after heard of. I could not rest satisfied with this imperfect\\r\\ninformation, and, though my hope of finding you was but languid,\\r\\nresolved to go in quest of you in person; for which purpose, I have\\r\\nremitted to Holland the value of twenty thousand pounds, and am in\\r\\npossession of fifteen thousand more, with which I intended to embark\\r\\nmyself on board of Captain Bowling, before I discovered this amazing\\r\\nstroke of Providence, which, you may be sure, has not altered my\\r\\nintention.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father, having entertained us with this agreeable sketch of his\\r\\nlife, withdrew, in order to relieve Don Antonio, who, in his absence,\\r\\nhad done the honours of his house; and I was just dressed for my\\r\\nappearance among the guests, when Strap arrived from the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe no sooner entered the grand apartment in which I was, and saw the\\r\\nmagnificence of my apparel, than his speech was lost in amazement, and\\r\\nhe gaped in silence at the objects that surrounded him. I took him by\\r\\nthe hand, observed that I had sent for him to be a witness and sharer\\r\\nof my happiness, and told him I had found a father. At these words he\\r\\nstarted, and, after having continued some minutes with his mouth and\\r\\neyes wide open, cried, â\\x80\\x9cAh!â\\x80\\x94odd, I know what! go thy ways, poor\\r\\nNarcissa, and go thy ways somebody elseâ\\x80\\x94wellâ\\x80\\x94Lord, what a thing is\\r\\nlove! God help us! are all our mad pranks and protestations come to\\r\\nthis? And have you fixed your habitation in this distant land? God\\r\\nprosper youâ\\x80\\x94I find we must part at lastâ\\x80\\x94for I would not leave my poor\\r\\ncarcase so far from my native home, for all the wealth of the\\r\\nuniverse!â\\x80\\x9d With these ejaculations, he began to sob and make wry faces;\\r\\nupon which I assured him of his mistake, both in regard to my staying\\r\\nin Paraguay, and informed him, as briefly as I could, of the great\\r\\nevent that had happened. Never was rapture more ludicrously expressed\\r\\nthan in the behaviour of this worthy creature, who cried, laughed,\\r\\nwhistled, sung, and danced, all in a breath. His transport was scarce\\r\\nover, when my father entered, who no sooner understood that this was\\r\\nStrap, than he took him by the hand, saying, â\\x80\\x9cIs this the honest man\\r\\nwho befriended you so much in your distress? You are welcome to my\\r\\nhouse, and I will soon put it in the power of my son to reward you for\\r\\nyour good offices in his behalf; in the meantime go with us and partake\\r\\nof the repast that is provided.â\\x80\\x9d Strap, wild as he was with joy, would\\r\\nby no means accept of the proffered honour, crying, â\\x80\\x9cGod forbid! I know\\r\\nmy distanceâ\\x80\\x94your worship shall excuse me.â\\x80\\x9d And Don Rodrigo, finding his\\r\\nmodesty invincible, recommended him to his major-domo, to be treated\\r\\nwith the utmost respect; while he carried me in a large saloon, where I\\r\\nwas presented to a numerous company, who loaded me with compliments and\\r\\ncaresses, and congratulated my father in terms not proper for me to\\r\\nrepeat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout specifying the particulars of our entertainment, let it suffice\\r\\nto say, it was at the same time elegant and sumptuous, and the\\r\\nrejoicings lasted two days; after which, Don Rodrigo settled his\\r\\naffairs, converted his effects into silver and gold, visited and took\\r\\nleave of all his friends, who were grieved at his departure, and\\r\\nhonoured me with considerable presents; and, coming on board of my\\r\\nuncleâ\\x80\\x99s ship, with the first fair wind we sailed from the Rio de la\\r\\nPlata, and in two months came safe to an anchor in the harbour of\\r\\nKingston, in the Island of Jamaica.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LXVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI visit my old Friend Thompsonâ\\x80\\x94we set sail for Europeâ\\x80\\x94meet with an odd\\r\\nAdventureâ\\x80\\x94arrive in Englandâ\\x80\\x94I ride across the Country from Portsmouth\\r\\nto Sussexâ\\x80\\x94converse with Mrs. Sagely, who informs me of Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s being\\r\\nin Londonâ\\x80\\x94in consequence of this Intelligence, I proceed to\\r\\nCanterburyâ\\x80\\x94meet with my old friend Morganâ\\x80\\x94arrive in Londonâ\\x80\\x94visit\\r\\nNarcissaâ\\x80\\x94introduce my Father to beâ\\x80\\x94he is charmed with her good sense\\r\\nand beautyâ\\x80\\x94we come to a Determination of demanding her Brotherâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nConsent to our Marriage\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI inquired, as soon as I got ashore, about my generous companion, Mr.\\r\\nThompson, and hearing that he lived in a flourishing condition upon the\\r\\nestate left him by his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s father, who had been dead some years, I\\r\\ntook horse immediately, with the consent of Don Rodrigo, who had heard\\r\\nme mention him with great regard, and in a few hours reached the place\\r\\nof his habitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should much wrong the delicacy of Mr. Thompsonâ\\x80\\x99s sentiments to say\\r\\nbarely he was glad to see me: he felt all that the most sensible and\\r\\ndisinterested friendship could feel on this occasion, introduced me to\\r\\nhis wife, a very amiable young lady, who had already blessed him with\\r\\ntwo fine children, and being as yet ignorant of my circumstances,\\r\\nfrankly offered me the assistance of his purse and interest. I thanked\\r\\nhim for his generous intention, and made him acquainted with my\\r\\nsituation, on which he congratulated me with great joy, and, after I\\r\\nhad stayed with him a whole day and night, accompanied me back to\\r\\nKingston, to wait upon my father, whom he invited to his house. Don\\r\\nRodrigo complied with his request, and, having been handsomely\\r\\nentertained during the space of a week, returned extremely well\\r\\nsatisfied with the behaviour of my friend and his lady, to whom, at\\r\\nparting, he presented a very valuable diamond ring, as a token of his\\r\\nesteem. During the course of my conversation with Mr. Thompson, he gave\\r\\nme to understand, that his old commander Captain Oakum was dead some\\r\\nmonths, and that, immediately after his death, a discovery had been\\r\\nmade of some valuable effects that he had feloniously secreted out of a\\r\\nprize by the assistance of Dr. Mackshane, who was now actually in\\r\\nprison on that account, and, being destitute of friends, subsisted\\r\\nsolely on the charity of my friend, whose bounty he had implored in the\\r\\nmost abject manner, after having been the barbarous occasion of driving\\r\\nhim to that terrible extremity on board of The Thunder, which we have\\r\\nformerly related. Whatsoever this wretch had been guilty of, I\\r\\napplauded Mr. Thompsonâ\\x80\\x99s generosity towards him in his distress, which\\r\\nwrought so much upon me also, that I sent him ten pistoles, in such a\\r\\nprivate manner that he could never know his benefactor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile my father and I were caressed among the gentlemen on shore,\\r\\nCaptain Bowling had written to his owners, by the packet, which sailed\\r\\na few days after our arrival, signifying his prosperous voyage\\r\\nhitherto, and desiring them to insure his ship and cargo homeward\\r\\nbound: after which precaution he applied himself so heartily to the\\r\\ntask of loading his ship that, with the assistance of Mr. Thompson, she\\r\\nwas full in less than six weeks. This kind gentleman likewise procured\\r\\nfor Don Rodrigo bills upon London for the greatest part of his gold and\\r\\nsilver, by which means it was secured against the risk of the seas and\\r\\nthe enemy; and, before we sailed, supplied us with such large\\r\\nquantities of all kinds of stock, that not only we, but the shipâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncompany, fared sumptuously during the voyage.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything being ready, we took our leave of our kind entertainers,\\r\\nand, going on board at Port Royal, set sail for England on the first\\r\\nday of June. We beat up to windward, with fine easy weather, and one\\r\\nnight believing ourselves near Cape Tiberon, lay to, with an intention\\r\\nto wood and water next morning in the bay. While we remained in this\\r\\nsituation, a sailor, having drunk more new rum than he could carry,\\r\\nstaggered over board, and, notwithstanding all the means that could be\\r\\nused to preserve him, went to the bottom, and disappeared. About two\\r\\nhours after this melancholy accident happened, as I enjoyed the cool\\r\\nair on the quarter-deck, I heard a voice rising, as it were, out of the\\r\\nsea and calling, â\\x80\\x9cHo, the ship ahoy!â\\x80\\x9d Upon which one of the men upon\\r\\nthe forecastle cried, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll be dâ\\x80\\x94nâ\\x80\\x99d if that anâ\\x80\\x99t Jack Marlinspike, who\\r\\nwent overboard!â\\x80\\x9d Not a little surprised at this event, I jumped into\\r\\nthe boat that lay alongside, with the second mate and four men, and\\r\\nrowing towards the place from whence the voice (which repeated the\\r\\nhail) seemed to proceed, we perceived something floating upon the\\r\\nwater. When we had rowed a little further, we discerned it to be a man\\r\\nriding upon a hencoop, who, seeing us approach, pronounced with a\\r\\nhoarse voice, â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n your bloods! why did you not answer when I hailed?â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nOur mate, who was a veritable seaman, hearing his salute, said, â\\x80\\x9cBy Gâ\\x80\\x94,\\r\\nmy lads, this is none of our man. This is the devilâ\\x80\\x94pull away for the\\r\\nship.â\\x80\\x9d The fellows obeyed his command without question, and were\\r\\nalready some fathoms on our return, when I insisted on their taking up\\r\\nthe poor creature, and prevailed upon them to go back to the wreck,\\r\\nwhich when we came near the second time, and signified our intention,\\r\\nwe received an answer of â\\x80\\x9cAvast, avastâ\\x80\\x94what ship, brother?â\\x80\\x9d Being\\r\\nsatisfied in this particular, he cried, â\\x80\\x9cDâ\\x80\\x94n the ship, I was in hopes\\r\\nit had been my ownâ\\x80\\x94where are you bound?â\\x80\\x9d We satisfied his curiosity in\\r\\nthis particular too; upon which he suffered himself to be taken on\\r\\nboard, and, after having been comforted with a dram, told us, he\\r\\nbelonged to the Vesuvio man-of-war, upon a cruise off the island of\\r\\nHispaniola; that he had fallen overboard four-and-twenty hours ago, and\\r\\nthe ship being under sail, they did not choose to bring to, but tossed\\r\\na hencoop overboard for his convenience, upon which he was in good\\r\\nhopes of reaching the Cape next morning: howsomever, he was as well\\r\\ncontent to be aboard of us because he did not doubt that we should meet\\r\\nhis ship, and if he had gone ashore in the bay, he might have been\\r\\ntaken prisoner by the French. My uncle and father were very much\\r\\ndiverted with the account of this fellowâ\\x80\\x99s unconcerned behaviour; and\\r\\nin two days, meeting with the Vesuvio, as he expected, sent him on\\r\\nboard of her, according to his desire.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving beat up successfully the windward passage, we stretched to the\\r\\nnorthward, and falling in with a westerly wind, in eight weeks arrived\\r\\nin the soundings, and in two days after made for the Lizard. It is\\r\\nimpossible to express the joy I felt at the sight of English ground!\\r\\nDon Rodrigo was not unmoved, and Strap shed tears of gladness. The\\r\\nsailors profited by our satisfaction, the shoe that was nailed to the\\r\\nmast being quite filled with our liberality. My uncle resolved to run\\r\\nup into the Downs at once, but the wind shifting when we were abreast\\r\\nof the Isle of Wight, he was obliged to turn into St. Helenâ\\x80\\x99s, and come\\r\\nto Spithead, to the great mortification of the crew, thirty of whom\\r\\nwere immediately pressed on board a man-of-war.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father and I went ashore immediately at Portsmouth, leaving Strap\\r\\nwith the captain to go round with the ship and take care of our\\r\\neffects; and I discovered so much impatience to see my charming\\r\\nNarcissa, that my father permitted me to ride across the country to her\\r\\nbrotherâ\\x80\\x99s house; while he should hire a post-chaise for London, where\\r\\nhe would wait for me at a place to which I directed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nFired with all the eagerness of passion, I took post that very night,\\r\\nand in the morning reached an inn about three miles from the squireâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhabitation; here I remained till next morning, allaying the torture of\\r\\nmy impatience with the rapturous hope of seeing that divine creature\\r\\nafter an absence of eighteen months, which, far from impairing, had\\r\\nraised my love to the most exalted pitch! Neither were my reflections\\r\\nfree from apprehensions: that something intervened in spite of all my\\r\\nhope, and represented her as having yielded to the importunity of her\\r\\nbrother and blessed the arms of a happy rival. My thoughts were even\\r\\nmaddened with the fear of her death; and, when I arrived in the dark at\\r\\nthe house of Mrs. Sagely, I had not for some time courage to desire\\r\\nadmittance, lest my soul should be shocked with dismal tidings. At\\r\\nlength, however, I knocked, and no sooner certified the good\\r\\ngentlewoman of my voice than she opened the door, and received me with\\r\\nthe most affectionate embrace, that brought tears into her aged eyes:\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake, dear mother,â\\x80\\x9d cried I, â\\x80\\x9ctell me how is Narcissa? is\\r\\nshe the same that I left her?â\\x80\\x9d She blessed my ears with saying, â\\x80\\x9cShe is\\r\\nas beautiful, in as good health, and as much yours as ever.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nTransported at this assurance, I begged to know if I could not see her\\r\\nthat very night, when this sage matron gave me to understand that my\\r\\nmistress was in London, and that things were strangely altered in the\\r\\nsquireâ\\x80\\x99s house since my departure; that he had been married a whole\\r\\nyear to Melinda, who at first found means to wean his attention so much\\r\\nfrom Narcissa, that he became quite careless of that lovely sister,\\r\\ncomforting himself with the clause in his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s will, by which she\\r\\nshould forfeit her fortune, by marrying without his consent: that my\\r\\nmistress, being but indifferently treated by her sister-in-law, had\\r\\nmade use of her freedom some months ago, and gone to town, where she\\r\\nwas lodged with Miss Williams, in expectation of my arrival; and had\\r\\nbeen pestered with the addresses of Lord Quiverwit, who, finding her\\r\\nheart engaged, had fallen upon a great many shifts to persuade her that\\r\\nI was dead; but, finding all his artifices unsuccessful, and despairing\\r\\nof gaining her affection, he had consoled himself for her indifference,\\r\\nby marrying another lady some weeks ago, who had already left him on\\r\\naccount of some family uneasiness. Besides this interesting\\r\\ninformation, she told me there was not a great deal of harmony between\\r\\nMelinda and the squire, who was so much disgusted at the number of\\r\\ngallants who continued to hover about her even after her marriage, that\\r\\nhe had hurried her down into the country, much against her own\\r\\ninclination, where their mutual animosities had risen to such a height,\\r\\nthat they preserved no decency before company or servants, but abused\\r\\none another in the grossest terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis good old gentlewoman, to give me a convincing proof of my dear\\r\\nNarcissaâ\\x80\\x99s unalterable love, gratified me with a sight of the last\\r\\nletter she had favoured her with, in which I was mentioned with so much\\r\\nhonour, tenderness, and concern, that my soul was fired with\\r\\nimpatience, and I determined to ride all night, that I might have it\\r\\nthe sooner in my power to make her happy. Mrs. Sagely, perceiving my\\r\\neagerness, and her maternal affection being equally divided between\\r\\nNarcissa and me, begged leave to remind me of the sentiments with which\\r\\nI went abroad, that would not permit me for any selfish gratification\\r\\nto prejudice the fortune of that amiable young lady, who must entirely\\r\\ndepend upon me, after having bestowed herself in marriage. I thanked\\r\\nher for her kind concern, and as briefly as possible described my\\r\\nflourishing situation, which afforded this humane person infinite\\r\\nwonder and satisfaction. I told her, that now I had an opportunity to\\r\\nmanifest my gratitude for the many obligations I owed, I would\\r\\nendeavour to make her old age comfortable and easy; as a step to which\\r\\nI proposed she should come and live with Narcissa and me. This\\r\\nvenerable gentlewoman was so much affected with my words, that the\\r\\ntears ran down her ancient cheeks; she thanked heaven that I had not\\r\\nbelied the presages she had made, on her first acquaintance with me;\\r\\nacknowledging my generosity, as she called it, in the most elegant and\\r\\npathetic expressions; but declined my proposal, on account of her\\r\\nattachment to the dear melancholy cottage where she had so peacefully\\r\\nconsumed her solitary widowhood. Finding her immovable on this subject,\\r\\nI insisted on her accepting a present of thirty guineas, and took my\\r\\nleave, resolving to accommodate her with the same sum annually, for the\\r\\nmore comfortable support of the infirmities of old age.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving rode all night, I found myself at Canterbury in the morning,\\r\\nwhere I alighted to procure fresh horses; and, as I walked into the\\r\\ninn, perceived an apothecaryâ\\x80\\x99s on the other side of the street, with\\r\\nthe name of Morgan over the door; alarmed at this discovery, I could\\r\\nnot help thinking that my old messmate had settled in this place, and\\r\\nupon inquiry found my conjecture true, and that he was married lately\\r\\nto a widow in that city, by whom he had got three thousand pounds.\\r\\nRejoiced at this intelligence, I went to his shop as soon as it was\\r\\nopen, and found my friend behind the counter, busy in preparing a\\r\\nclyster. I saluted him at entrance, with, â\\x80\\x9cYour servant, Mr. Morgan.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nUpon which he looked at me, and replying, â\\x80\\x9cYour most humble servant,\\r\\ngood sir,â\\x80\\x9d rubbed his ingredients in the mortar without any emotion.\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat,â\\x80\\x9d said I, â\\x80\\x9cMorgan, have you forgot your old messmate?â\\x80\\x9d At these\\r\\nwords he looked up again, and starting, cried, â\\x80\\x9cAs Cot is myâ\\x80\\x94sure it\\r\\ncannotâ\\x80\\x94yes, by my salfation, I pelieve it is my dear friend Mr.\\r\\nRantom.â\\x80\\x9d He was no sooner convinced of my identity, than he threw down\\r\\nthe pestle, overset the mortar, and jumping over the board, swept up\\r\\nthe contents with his clothes, flew about my neck, hugged me\\r\\naffectionately, and daubed me all over with turpentine and the yolks of\\r\\neggs which he had been mixing when I came in. Our mutual\\r\\ncongratulations being over, he told me, that he found himself a widower\\r\\nupon his return from the West Indies; that he had got interest to be\\r\\nappointed surgeon of a man-of-war, in which capacity he had served some\\r\\nyears, until he married an apothecaryâ\\x80\\x99s widow, with whom he now enjoyed\\r\\na pretty good sum of money, peace, and quiet, and an indifferent good\\r\\ntrade. He was very desirous of hearing my adventures, which I assured\\r\\nhim I had not time to relate, but told him in general, my circumstances\\r\\nwere very good, and that I hoped to see him when I should not be in\\r\\nsuch a hurry as at present. He insisted, however, on my staying\\r\\nbreakfast, and introduced me to his wife, who seemed to be a decent\\r\\nsensible woman, pretty well stricken in years. In the course of our\\r\\nconversation, he showed the sleeve-buttons I had exchanged with him at\\r\\nour parting in the West Indies, and was not a little proud to see that\\r\\nI had preserved his with the same care. When I informed him of\\r\\nMackshaneâ\\x80\\x99s condition, he seemed at first to exult over his distress;\\r\\nbut, after a little recollection, said, â\\x80\\x9cWell, he has paid for his\\r\\nmalice; I forgife him, and may Cot forgife him likewise.â\\x80\\x9d He expressed\\r\\ngreat concern for the soul of Captain Oakum, which he believed was now\\r\\ngnashing its teeth; but it was some time before I could convince him of\\r\\nThompsonâ\\x80\\x99s being alive, at whose good fortune, nevertheless, he was\\r\\nextremely glad.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving renewed our protestations of friendship, I bade the honest\\r\\nWelshman and his spouse farewell, and, taking post-horses, arrived at\\r\\nLondon that same night, where I found my father in good health, to whom\\r\\nI imparted what I had learned of Narcissa. This indulgent parent\\r\\napproved of my intention of marrying her, even without fortune,\\r\\nprovided her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s consent could not be obtained; promised to make\\r\\nover to me in a few days a sufficiency to maintain her in a fashionable\\r\\nmanner and expressed a desire of seeing this amiable creature, who had\\r\\ncaptivated me so much. As I had not slept the night before, and was\\r\\nbesides fatigued with my journey, I found myself under a necessity of\\r\\ntaking some repose, and went to bed accordingly: next morning, about\\r\\nten oâ\\x80\\x99clock, took a chair, and according to Mrs. Sagelyâ\\x80\\x99s directions,\\r\\nwent to my charmerâ\\x80\\x99s lodgings, and inquired for Miss Williams. I had\\r\\nnot waited in the parlour longer than a minute, when this young woman\\r\\nentered, and no sooner perceived me, than she shrieked and ran\\r\\nbackward: but I got between her and the door, and clasping her in my\\r\\narms, brought her to herself with an embrace. â\\x80\\x9cGood heaven,â\\x80\\x9d cried she,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Random, is it you indeed? My mistress will run distracted with\\r\\njoy.â\\x80\\x9d I told her, it was from an apprehension that my sudden appearance\\r\\nmight have had some bad effect on my dear Narcissa, that I had desired\\r\\nto see her first, in order to concert some method of acquainting her\\r\\nmistress gradually with my arrival. She approved of my conduct, and,\\r\\nafter having yielded to the suggestions of her own friendship, in\\r\\nasking if my voyage had been successful, charged herself with that\\r\\noffice, and left me glowing with desire of seeing and embracing the\\r\\nobject of my love. In a very little time I heard some body coming down\\r\\nthe stairs in haste, and the voice of my angel pronounce, with an eager\\r\\ntone, â\\x80\\x9cO heaven! is it possible! where is he?â\\x80\\x9d How were my faculties\\r\\naroused at this well known sound! and how was my soul transported when\\r\\nshe broke in upon my view in all the bloom of ripened beauty! Grace was\\r\\nin all her steps, heaven in her eye, in every gesture dignity and love!\\r\\nYou, whose souls are susceptible of the most delicate impressions,\\r\\nwhose tender bosoms have felt the affecting vicissitudes of love, who\\r\\nhave suffered an absence of eighteen long months from the dear object\\r\\nof your hope, and found at your return the melting fair as kind and\\r\\nconstant as your heart can wish, do me justice on this occasion, and\\r\\nconceive what unutterable rapture possessed us both, while we flew into\\r\\neach otherâ\\x80\\x99s arms! This was no time for speech: locked in a mutual\\r\\nembrace, we continued some minutes in a silent trance of joy! When I\\r\\nthus encircled all my soul held dearâ\\x80\\x94while I hung over her\\r\\nbeautiesâ\\x80\\x94beheld her eyes sparkle, and every feature flush with virtuous\\r\\nfondnessâ\\x80\\x94when I saw her enchanting bosom heave with undissembled\\r\\nrapture, and knew myself the happy causeâ\\x80\\x94heavens! what was my\\r\\nsituation! I am tempted to commit my paper to the flames, and to\\r\\nrenounce my pen for ever, because its most ardent and lucky expression\\r\\nso poorly describes the emotions of my soul. â\\x80\\x9cO adorable Narcissa!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncried I, â\\x80\\x9cO miracle of beauty, love and truth! I at last fold thee in\\r\\nmy arms! I at last can call thee mine! No jealous brother shall thwart\\r\\nour happiness again; fortune hath at length recompensed me for all my\\r\\nsufferings, and enabled me to do justice to my love.â\\x80\\x9d The dear creature\\r\\nsmiled ineffably charmingly, and, with a look of bewitching tenderness,\\r\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x9cand shall we never part again?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cNever,â\\x80\\x9d I replied, â\\x80\\x9cthou\\r\\nwondrous pattern of all earthly perfection! never, until death shall\\r\\ndivide us! By this ambrosial kiss, a thousand times more fragrant than\\r\\nthe breeze that sweeps the orange grove, I never more will leave thee!â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs my first transport abated, my passion grew turbulent and unruly. I\\r\\nwas giddy with standing on the brink of bliss, and all my virtue and\\r\\nphilosophy were scarce sufficient to restrain the inordinate sallies of\\r\\ndesire. Narcissa perceived the conflict within me, and with her usual\\r\\ndignity of prudence, called off my imagination from the object in view,\\r\\nand with eager expressions of interested curiosity, desired to know the\\r\\nparticulars of my voyage. In this I gratified her inclination, bringing\\r\\nmy story down to the present hour. She was infinitely surprised at the\\r\\ncircumstance of finding my father, which brought tears into her lovely\\r\\neyes. She was transported at hearing that approved of my flame,\\r\\ndiscovered a longing desire of being introduced to him, congratulated\\r\\nherself and me upon my good fortune, and observed, that this great and\\r\\nunexpected stroke of fate seemed to have been brought about by the\\r\\nimmediate direction of Providence. Having entertained ourselves some\\r\\nhours with the genuine effusions of our souls, I obtained her consent\\r\\nto complete my happiness as soon as my father should judge it proper;\\r\\nand, applying with my own hands a valuable necklace, composed of\\r\\ndiamonds and amethysts set alternately, which an old Spanish lady at\\r\\nParaguay had presented me with, I took my leave, promising to return in\\r\\nthe afternoon with Don Rodrigo. When I went home, this generous parent\\r\\ninquired very affectionately about the health of my dear Narcissa, to\\r\\nwhom, that I might be the more agreeable, he put into my hand a deed,\\r\\nby which I found myself in possession of fifteen thousand pounds,\\r\\nexclusive of the profits of my own merchandise, which amounted to three\\r\\nthousand more. After dinner I accompanied him to the lodgings of my\\r\\nmistress, who, being dressed for the occasion, made a most dazzling\\r\\nappearance. I could perceive him struck with her figure, which I really\\r\\nthink was the most beautiful that ever was created under the sun. He\\r\\nembraced her tenderly, and told her he was proud of having a son who\\r\\nhad spirit to attempt, and qualifications to engage the affections of\\r\\nsuch a fine lady. She blushed at this compliment, and, with eyes full\\r\\nof the softest languishment turned upon me, said, she should have been\\r\\nunworthy of Mr. Randomâ\\x80\\x99s attention, had she been blind to his\\r\\nextraordinary merit. I made no other answer than a low bow. My father,\\r\\nsighing, pronounced, â\\x80\\x9cSuch was once my Charlotte;â\\x80\\x9d while the tear\\r\\nrushed into his eye, and the tender heart of Narcissa manifested itself\\r\\nin two precious drops of sympathy, which, but for his presence, I would\\r\\nhave kissed away. Without repeating the particulars of our\\r\\nconversation, I shall only observe, that Don Rodrigo was as much\\r\\ncharmed with her good sense as with her appearance, and she was no less\\r\\npleased with his understanding and polite address. It was determined\\r\\nthat he should write to the squire, signifying his approbation of my\\r\\npassion for his sister, and offering a settlement, which he should have\\r\\nno reason to reject; and that, if he should refuse the proposal, we\\r\\nwould crown our mutual wishes without any further regard to his will.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Father makes a present to Narcissaâ\\x80\\x94the Letter is dispatched to her\\r\\nBrotherâ\\x80\\x94I appear among my Acquaintanceâ\\x80\\x94Banterâ\\x80\\x99s Behaviourâ\\x80\\x94the Squire\\r\\nrefuses his Consentâ\\x80\\x94my Uncle comes to Townâ\\x80\\x94approves of my Choiceâ\\x80\\x94I am\\r\\nmarriedâ\\x80\\x94we meet the Squire and his Lady at the Playâ\\x80\\x94our Acquaintance is\\r\\ncourted\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having spent the evening to the satisfaction of all present, my\\r\\nfather addressed himself thus to Narcissa. â\\x80\\x9cMadam, give me leave to\\r\\nconsider you hereafter as my daughter, in which capacity I insist upon\\r\\nyour accepting this first instance of my paternal duty and affection.â\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nWith these words he put into her hand a bank note of five hundred\\r\\npounds, which she no sooner examined, than with a low courtesy she\\r\\nreplied. â\\x80\\x9cDear sir, though I have not the least occasion for this\\r\\nsupply, I have too great a veneration for you to refuse this proof of\\r\\nyour generosity and esteem, which I the more freely receive, because I\\r\\nalready look upon Mr. Randomâ\\x80\\x99s interest as inseparably connected with\\r\\nmine.â\\x80\\x9d He was extremely well pleased with her frank and ingenuous\\r\\nreply, upon which we saluted, and wished her good night. The letter, at\\r\\nmy request, was dispatched to Sussex by an express, and in the\\r\\nmeantime, Don Rodrigo, to grace my nuptials, hired a ready furnished\\r\\nhouse, and set up a very handsome equipage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough I passed the greatest part of the day with the darling of my\\r\\nsoul, I found leisure sometimes to be among my former acquaintance, who\\r\\nwere astonished at the magnificence of my appearance. Banter in\\r\\nparticular was confounded at the vicissitudes of my fortune, the causes\\r\\nof which he endeavoured in vain to discover, until I thought fit to\\r\\ndisclose the whole secret of my last voyage, partly in consideration of\\r\\nour former intimacy, and partly to prevent unfavourable conjectures,\\r\\nwhich he and others, in all probability, would have made in regard to\\r\\nmy circumstances. He professed great satisfaction at this piece of\\r\\nnews; and I had no cause to believe him insincere, when I considered\\r\\nthat he would now look upon himself as acquitted of the debt he owed\\r\\nme, and at the same time flatter himself with the hopes of borrowing\\r\\nmore. I carried him home to dinner with me, and my father liked his\\r\\nconversation so much, that, upon hearing his difficulties, he desired\\r\\nme to accommodate him for the present, and inquire, if he would accept\\r\\nof a commission in the army, towards the purchase of which he should\\r\\nwillingly lend him money. Accordingly, I gave my friend an opportunity\\r\\nof being alone with me, when, as I expected, he told me that he was\\r\\njust on the point of being reconciled to an old rich uncle, whose heir\\r\\nhe was, but wanted a few pieces for immediate expense, which he desired\\r\\nI would lend him and take my bond for the whole. His demand was limited\\r\\nto ten guineas; and when I put twenty in his hand, he stared at me for\\r\\nsome moments; then, putting it into his purse, â\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x94â\\x80\\x99tis all oneâ\\x80\\x94you\\r\\nshall have the whole in a very short time.â\\x80\\x9d When I had taken his note,\\r\\nto save the expense of a bond, I expressed some surprise that a fellow\\r\\nof his spirit should loiter away his time in idleness, and, asked why\\r\\nhe did not choose to make his fortune in the army. â\\x80\\x9cWhat,â\\x80\\x9d said he,\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthrow away money upon a subalternâ\\x80\\x99s commission, and be under the\\r\\ncommand of a parcel of scoundrels, who have raised themselves above me\\r\\nby the most infamous practices. No, I love independency too well to\\r\\nsacrifice my life, health, and pleasure, for such a pitiful\\r\\nconsideration.â\\x80\\x9d Finding him adverse to this way of life, I changed the\\r\\nsubject, and returned to Don Rodrigo, who had just received the\\r\\nfollowing epistle from the squire:\\r\\n\\r\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSir,â\\x80\\x94Concerning a letter which I received, subscribed R. Random, this\\r\\nis the answer. As for you, I know nothing of you. Your son, or\\r\\npretended son, I have seen; if he marries my sister, at his peril be\\r\\nit; I do declare that he shall not have one farthing of her fortune,\\r\\nwhich becomes my property, if she takes a husband without my consent.\\r\\nYour settlement, I do believe, is all a sham, and yourself no better\\r\\nthan you should be; but if you had all the wealth of the Indies, your\\r\\nson shall never match in our family with the consent of\\r\\n    â\\x80\\x9cOrson Topehallâ\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father was not much surprised at this polite letter, after having\\r\\nheard the character of the author; and as for me, I was even pleased at\\r\\nhis refusal, because I had now an opportunity of showing my\\r\\ndisinterested love. By his permission I waited on my charmer: and\\r\\nhaving imparted the contents of her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s letter, at which she wept\\r\\nbitterly, in spite of all my consolation and caresses, the time of our\\r\\nmarriage was fixed two days. During this interval, in which my soul was\\r\\nwound up to the last stretch of rapturous expectation, Narcissa\\r\\nendeavoured to reconcile some of her relations in town to her marriage\\r\\nwith me; but, finding them all deaf to her remonstrances, either out of\\r\\nenvy or prejudice, she told me with the most enchanting sweetness,\\r\\nwhile the tears bedewed her lovely cheeks, â\\x80\\x9cSure the world will no\\r\\nlonger question your generosity when you take a poor forlorn beggar to\\r\\nyour arms?â\\x80\\x9d Affected with her sorrow, I pressed the fair mourner to my\\r\\nbreast, and swore that she was more dear and welcome on that account,\\r\\nbecause she had sacrificed her friends and fortune to her love for me.\\r\\nMy uncle, for whose character she had a great veneration, being by this\\r\\ntime come to town, I introduced him to my bride; and, although he was\\r\\nnot very much subject to refined sensations, he was struck dumb with\\r\\nadmiration at her beauty. After having kissed and gazed at her for some\\r\\ntime, he turned to me, saying. â\\x80\\x9cOdds bobs, Rory! a notable prize\\r\\nindeed, finely built and gloriously rigged, iâ\\x80\\x99faith! If she anâ\\x80\\x99t well\\r\\nmanned when you take the command of her, sirrah, you deserve to go to\\r\\nsea in a cockle shell. No offence, I hope, niece! you must not mind\\r\\nwhat I say, being (as the saying is) a plain seafaring man, though\\r\\nmayhap I have as much regard for you as another.â\\x80\\x9d She received him with\\r\\ngreat civility, told him she had longed a great while to see a person\\r\\nto whom she was so much indebted for his generosity to Mr. Random; that\\r\\nshe looked upon him as her uncle, by which name she begged leave to\\r\\ncall him for the future; and that she was very sure he could say\\r\\nnothing that would give her the least offence. The honest captain was\\r\\ntransported at her courteous behaviour, and insisted upon giving her\\r\\naway at the ceremony, swearing that he loved her as well as if she was\\r\\nhis own child, and that he would give two thousand guineas to the first\\r\\nfruit of our love, as soon as it would squeak. Everything being settled\\r\\nfor the solemnisation of our nuptials, which were to be performed\\r\\nprivately at my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house, the auspicious hour arrived, when Don\\r\\nRodrigo and my uncle went in the coach to fetch the bride and Miss\\r\\nWilliams: leaving me with a parson, Banter, and Strap, neither of whom\\r\\nhad as yet seen my charming mistress. My faithful valet, who was on the\\r\\nrack of impatience to behold a lady of whom he had heard so much, no\\r\\nsooner understood that the coach was returned, than he placed himself\\r\\nat a window, to have a peep at her as she alighted; and, when he saw\\r\\nher, clapped his hands together, turned up the white of his eyes, and,\\r\\nwith his mouth wide open, remained in a sort of ecstacy, which broke\\r\\nout into â\\x80\\x9cO Dea certe! qualis in Eurotae ripis, aut per iuga Cynthi\\r\\nexercet Diana choros?â\\x80\\x9d The doctor and Banter were surprised to hear my\\r\\nman speak Latin; but when my father led Narcissa into the room, the\\r\\nobject of their admiration was soon changed, as appeared in the\\r\\ncountenances of both. Indeed, they must have been the most insensible\\r\\nof all beings, could they have beheld without emotion the divine\\r\\ncreature that approached! She was dressed in a sack of white satin,\\r\\nembroidered on the breast with gold, the crown of her head was covered\\r\\nwith a small French cap, from whence descended her beautiful hair in\\r\\nringlets that waved upon her snowy neck, which dignified the necklace I\\r\\nhad given her; her looks glowed with modesty and love; and her bosom,\\r\\nthrough the veil of gauze that shaded it, afforded a prospect of\\r\\nElysium! I received this inestimable gift of Providence as became me;\\r\\nand in a little time the clergyman did his office, my uncle, at his own\\r\\nearnest request, acting the part of a father to my dear Narcissa, who\\r\\ntrembled very much, and had scarce spirits sufficient to support her\\r\\nunder this great change of situation. Soon as she was mine by the laws\\r\\nor heaven and earth, I printed a burning kiss upon her lips; my father\\r\\nembraced her tenderly, my uncle hugged her with great affection, and I\\r\\npresented her to my friend Banter, who saluted her in a very polite\\r\\nmanner; Miss Williams hung round her neck, and went plentifully; while\\r\\nStrap fell upon his knees, and begged to kiss his ladyâ\\x80\\x99s hand, which\\r\\nshe presented with great affability. I shall not pretend to describe my\\r\\nown feelings at this juncture; let it suffice to say that having supped\\r\\nand entertained ourselves till ten oâ\\x80\\x99clock, I cautioned my Narcissa\\r\\nagainst exposing her health by sitting up too late, and she was\\r\\nprevailed upon to withdraw with her maid to an apartment destined for\\r\\nus. When she left the room, her face overspread with a blush that set\\r\\nall my blood in a state of fermentation, and made every pulse beat with\\r\\ntenfold vigour! She was so cruel as to let me remain in this condition\\r\\na full half-hour: when, no longer able to restrain my impatience, I\\r\\nbroke from the company, burst into her chamber, pushed out her\\r\\nconfidante, and locked the door, and found herâ\\x80\\x94O heaven and earth!â\\x80\\x94a\\r\\nfeast a thousand times more delicious than my most sanguine hopes\\r\\npresaged! But, let me not profane the chaste mysteries of Hymen. I was\\r\\nthe happiest of men!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning I was awaked by three or four drums, which Banter had\\r\\nplaced under the window; upon which I withdrew the curtain, and enjoyed\\r\\nthe unspeakable satisfaction of contemplating those angelic charms\\r\\nwhich were now in my possession! Beauty! which, whether sleeping or\\r\\nawake, shot forth peculiar graces! The light darting upon my Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\neyes, she awoke also, and recollecting her situation, hid her blushes\\r\\nin my bosom. I was distracted with joy! I could not believe the\\r\\nevidence of my senses, and looked upon all that had happened as the\\r\\nfictions of a dream! In the meantime my uncle knocked at the door, and\\r\\nbade me turn out, for I had had a long spell. I rose accordingly, and\\r\\nsent Miss Williams to her mistress, myself receiving the congratulation\\r\\nof Captain Bowling, who rallied me in his sea phrase with great\\r\\nsuccess. In less than an hour, Don Rodrigo led my wife into breakfast,\\r\\nwhere she received the compliments of the company on her looks, which,\\r\\nthey said, if possible, were improved by matrimony. As her delicate\\r\\nears were offended with none of those indecent ambiguities which are\\r\\ntoo often spoken on such occasions, she behaved with dignity,\\r\\nunaffected modesty, and ease; and, as a testimony of my affection and\\r\\nesteem, I presented her, in presence of them all, with a deed, by which\\r\\nI settled the whole fortune I was possessed of on her and her heirs for\\r\\never. She accepted it with a glance of most tender acknowledgment,\\r\\nobserved, that she could not be surprised at anything of this kind I\\r\\nshould do, and desired my father to take the trouble of keeping it,\\r\\nsaying, â\\x80\\x9cNext to my own Mr. Random, you are the person in whom I ought\\r\\nto have the greatest confidence.â\\x80\\x9d Charmed with her prudent and\\r\\ningenuous manner of proceeding, he took the paper, and assured her that\\r\\nit should not lose its value while in his custody.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we had not many visits to give and receive, the little time we\\r\\nstayed in town was spent in going to public diversions, where I have\\r\\nthe vanity to think Narcissa was seldom eclipsed. One night, in\\r\\nparticular, we sent our footman to keep one of the stage boxes, which\\r\\nwe no sooner entered, than we perceived in the opposite box the squire\\r\\nand his lady, who seemed not a little surprised at seeing us. I was\\r\\npleased at this opportunity of confronting them; the more, because\\r\\nMelinda was robbed of all her admirers by my wife, who happened that\\r\\nnight to outshine her sister both in beauty and dress. She was piqued\\r\\nat Narcissaâ\\x80\\x99s victory, tossed her head a thousand different ways,\\r\\nflirted her fan, looked at us with disdain, then whispered to her\\r\\nhusband, and broke out into an affected giggle; but all her arts proved\\r\\nineffectual, either to discompose Mrs. Random, or to conceal her own\\r\\nmortification, which at length forced her away long before the play was\\r\\ndone. The news of our marriage being spread, with many circumstances to\\r\\nour disadvantage, by the industry of this malignant creature, a certain\\r\\nset of persons fond of scandal began to inquire into the particulars of\\r\\nmy fortune, which they no sooner understood to be independent, than the\\r\\ntables were turned, and our acquaintance was courted as much as it had\\r\\nbeen despised before: but she had too much dignity of pride to\\r\\nencourage this change of conduct, especially in her relations, whom she\\r\\ncould never be prevailed upon to see, after the malicious reports they\\r\\nhad raised to her prejudice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER LXIX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father intends to revisit the Place of his Nativityâ\\x80\\x94we propose to\\r\\naccompany himâ\\x80\\x94my Uncle renews his will in my favour, determining to go\\r\\nto sea againâ\\x80\\x94we set out for Scotlandâ\\x80\\x94arrive at Edinburghâ\\x80\\x94purchase our\\r\\npaternal Estateâ\\x80\\x94proceed to itâ\\x80\\x94halt at the Town where I was\\r\\neducatedâ\\x80\\x94take up my bond to Crabâ\\x80\\x94the Behaviour of Potion and his Wife,\\r\\nand one of our Female Cousinsâ\\x80\\x94our Reception at the Estateâ\\x80\\x94Strap marries\\r\\nMiss Williams, and is settled by my Father to his own satisfactionâ\\x80\\x94I am\\r\\nmore and more happy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father intending to revisit his native country, and pay the tribute\\r\\nof a few tears at my motherâ\\x80\\x99s grave, Narcissa and I resolved to\\r\\naccompany him in the execution of his pious office, and accordingly\\r\\nprepared for the journey, in which, however, my uncle would not engage,\\r\\nbeing resolved to try his fortune once more at sea. In the meantime he\\r\\nrenewed his will in favour of my wife and me, and deposited it in the\\r\\nhands of his brother-in-law: while I (that I might not be wanting to my\\r\\nown interest) summoned the squire to produce his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s will at\\r\\nDoctorsâ\\x80\\x99 Commons, and employed a proctor to manage the affair in my\\r\\nabsence.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything being thus settled, we took leave of all our friends in\\r\\nLondon, and set out for Scotland, Don Rodrigo, Narcissa, Miss Williams,\\r\\nand I, in the coach, and Strap, with two men in livery, on horseback;\\r\\nas we made easy stages, my charmer held it out very well, till we\\r\\narrived at Edinburgh, where we proposed to rest ourselves some weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Don Rodrigo having intelligence that the foxhunter had spoilt his\\r\\nestate, which was to be exposed to sale by public auction, he\\r\\ndetermined to make a purchase of the spot where he was born, and\\r\\nactually bought all the land that belonged to his father.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a few days after this bargain was made, we left Edinburgh, in order\\r\\nto go and take possession; and by the way halted one night in that town\\r\\nwhere I was educated. Upon inquiry, I found that Mr. Crab was dead;\\r\\nwhereupon I sent for his executor, paid the sum I owed with interest,\\r\\nand took up my bond. Mr. Potion and his wife, hearing of my arrival,\\r\\nhad the assurance to come to the inn where we lodged, and send up their\\r\\nnames, with the desire of being permitted to pay their respects to my\\r\\nfather and me: but their sordid behaviour towards me, when I was an\\r\\norphan, had made too deep an impression on my mind to be effaced by\\r\\nthis mean mercenary piece of condescension: I therefore rejected their\\r\\nmessage with disdain, and bade Strap tell them, that my father and I\\r\\ndesired to have no communication with such low-minded wretches as they\\r\\nwere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not been gone half-an-hour, when a woman, without any\\r\\nceremony, opened the door of the room where we sat, and, making towards\\r\\nmy father, accosted him with, â\\x80\\x9cUncle, your servantâ\\x80\\x94I am glad to see\\r\\nyou.â\\x80\\x9d This was no other than one of my female cousins, mentioned in the\\r\\nfirst part of my memoirs, to whom Don Rodrigo replied, â\\x80\\x9cPray, who are\\r\\nyou, madam?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cOh!â\\x80\\x9d cried she, â\\x80\\x9cmy cousin Rory there knows me very well.\\r\\nDonâ\\x80\\x99t you remember me, Rory?â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYes, madam,â\\x80\\x9d said I; â\\x80\\x9cfor my own part, I\\r\\nshall never forget you. Sir, this is one of the young ladies, who (as I\\r\\nhave formerly told you) treated me so humanely in my childhood!â\\x80\\x9d When I\\r\\npronounced these words, my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s resentment glowed in his visage,\\r\\nand he ordered her to be gone, with such a commanding aspect, that she\\r\\nretired in a fright, muttering curses as she went downstairs. We\\r\\nafterwards learned that she was married to an ensign, who had already\\r\\nspent all her fortune; and that her sister had borne a child to her\\r\\nmotherâ\\x80\\x99s footman, who is now her husband, and keeps a petty alehouse in\\r\\nthe country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fame of our flourishing condition having arrived at this place\\r\\nbefore us, we got notice that the magistrates intended next day to\\r\\ncompliment us with the freedom of their town; upon which my father,\\r\\nconsidering their complaisance in the right point of view, ordered the\\r\\nhorses to the coach early in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe proceeded to our estate, which lay about twenty miles from this\\r\\nplace; and, when we came within half-a-league of the house, were met by\\r\\na prodigious number of poor tenants, men, women, and children, who\\r\\ntestified their joy by loud acclamations, and accompanied our coach to\\r\\nthe gate. As there is no part of the world in which the peasants are\\r\\nmore attached to their lords than in Scotland, we were almost devoured\\r\\nby their affections. My father had always been their favourite, and now\\r\\nthat he appeared their master, after having been thought dead so long,\\r\\ntheir joy broke out into a thousand extravagances. When we entered the\\r\\ncourt yard, we were surrounded by a vast number, who crowded together\\r\\nso closely to see us that several were in danger of being squeezed to\\r\\ndeath; those who were near Don Rodrigo fell upon their knees, and\\r\\nkissed his hand, or the hem of his garment, praying aloud for long life\\r\\nand prosperity to him; others approached Narcissa and me in the same\\r\\nmanner; while the rest clapped their hands at a distance, and invoked\\r\\nheaven to shower its choicest blessings on our heads! In short, the\\r\\nwhole scene, though rude, was so affecting, that the gentle partner of\\r\\nmy heart wept over it, and my father himself could not refrain from\\r\\ndropping a tear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving welcomed his daughter and me to his house, he ordered some\\r\\nbullocks to be killed, and some hogsheads of ale to be brought from the\\r\\nneighbouring village, to regale these honest people, who had not\\r\\nenjoyed such a holiday for many years before.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day we were visited by the gentlemen in the neighbourhood, most of\\r\\nthem our relations, one of whom brought along my cousin, the foxhunter,\\r\\nwho had stayed at his house since he was obliged to leave his own! My\\r\\nfather was generous enough to receive him kindly, and even promised to\\r\\npurchase for him a commission in the army, for which he expressed great\\r\\nthankfulness and joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy charming Narcissa was universally admired and loved for her beauty,\\r\\naffability, and good sense; and so well pleased with the situation of\\r\\nthe place, and the company round, that she has not as yet discovered\\r\\nthe least desire of changing her habitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had not been many days settled, when I prevailed upon my father to\\r\\npay a visit to the village where I had been at school. Here we were\\r\\nreceived by the principal inhabitants, who entertained us in the\\r\\nchurch, where Mr. Syntax the schoolmaster (my tyrant being dead)\\r\\npronounced a Latin oration in honour of our family. And none exerted\\r\\nthemselves more than Strapâ\\x80\\x99s father and relations, who looked upon the\\r\\nhonest valet as the first gentleman of their race, and honoured his\\r\\nbenefactors accordingly. Having received the homage of this place, we\\r\\nretired, leaving forty pounds for the benefit of the poor of the\\r\\nparish; and that very night, Strap being a little elevated with the\\r\\nregard that had been shown to him, and to me on his account, ventured\\r\\nto tell me, that he had a sneaking kindness for Miss Williams, and\\r\\nthat, if his lady and I would use our interest in his behalf, he did\\r\\nnot doubt that she would listen to his addresses. Surprised at this\\r\\nproposal, I asked if he knew the story of that unfortunate young\\r\\ngentlewoman; upon which he replied, â\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, I know what you meanâ\\x80\\x94she\\r\\nhas been unhappy, I grant youâ\\x80\\x94but what of that? I am convinced of her\\r\\nreformation; or else you and my good lady would not treat her with such\\r\\nrespect. As for the censure of the world, I value it not a figâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nendâ\\x80\\x94besides, the world knows nothing of the matter.â\\x80\\x9d I commended his\\r\\nphilosophy, and interested Narcissa in his cause; who interceded so\\r\\neffectually, that in a little time Miss Williams yielded her consent,\\r\\nand they were married at the approbation of Don Rodrigo, who gave him\\r\\nfive hundred pounds to stock a farm, and made him overseer of his\\r\\nestate. My generous bedfellow gave her maid the same sum; so that they\\r\\nlive in great peace and plenty within half-a-mile of us, and daily put\\r\\nup prayers for our preservation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there be such a thing as true happiness on earth, I enjoy it. The\\r\\nimpetuous transports of my passion are now settled and mellowed into\\r\\nendearing fondness and tranquillity of love, rooted by that intimate\\r\\nconnection and interchange of hearts which nought but virtuous wedlock\\r\\ncan produce. Fortune seems determined to make ample amends for her\\r\\nformer cruelty, for my proctor writes that, notwithstanding the clause\\r\\nin my father-in-lawâ\\x80\\x99s will, on which the squire founds his claim, I\\r\\nshall certainly recover my wifeâ\\x80\\x99s fortune, in consequence of a codicil\\r\\nannexed, which explains that clause, and limits her restriction to the\\r\\nage of nineteen, after which she was at her own disposal. I would have\\r\\nset out for London immediately after receiving this piece of\\r\\nintelligence, but my dear angel has been qualmish of late, and begins\\r\\nto grow remarkably round in the waist; so that I cannot leave her in\\r\\nsuch an interesting situation, which I hope will produce something to\\r\\ncrown my felicity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF RODERICK RANDOM ***\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\r\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
